A man is an adult male human.[a][2][3] Before adulthood, a male child or adolescent is referred to as a boy.
Like most other male mammals, a man's genome usually inherits an X chromosome from the mother and a Y chromosome from the father. Sex differentiation of the male fetus is governed by the SRY gene on the Y chromosome. During puberty, hormones which stimulate androgen production result in the development of secondary sexual characteristics that result in even more differences between the sexes. These include greater muscle mass, greater height, the growth of facial hair and a lower body fat composition. Male anatomy is distinguished from female anatomy by the male reproductive system, which includes the testicles, sperm ducts, prostate gland and epididymides, and penis. Secondary sex characteristics include a narrower pelvis and hips, and smaller breasts and nipples.
Throughout human history, traditional gender roles have often defined men's activities and opportunities. Men often face conscription into military service or are directed into professions with high mortality rates. Many religious doctrines stipulate certain rules for men, such as religious circumcision. Men are over-represented as both perpetrators and victims of violence.
Trans men have a gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, while intersex men may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male biology.
The English term "man" is derived from the Proto-Indo-European root *man- (see Sanskrit/Avestan manu-, Slavic mǫž "man, male").[4] More directly, the word derives from Old English mann. The Old English form primarily meant "person" or "human being" and referred to men, women, and children alike. The Old English word for "man" as distinct from "wif"/"woman" or "child" was wer. Mann only came to mean "man" in Middle English, replacing wer, which survives today only in the compounds "werewolf" (from Old English werwulf, literally "man-wolf"), and "wergild", literally "man-payment".[5][6][7]
In humans, sperm cells carry either an X or a Y sex chromosome. If a sperm cell carrying a Y chromosome fertilizes the female ovum, the offspring will have a male karyotype (XY). The SRY gene is typically found on the Y chromosome and causes the development of the testes, which in turn govern other aspects of male sex differentiation. Sex differentiation in males proceeds in a testes-dependent way while female differentiation is not gonad dependent.[8]
Primary sex characteristics (or sex organs) are characteristics that are present at birth and are integral to the reproductive process. For men, primary sex characteristics include the penis and testicles.
Adult humans exhibit sexual dimorphism in many other characteristics, many of which have no direct link to reproductive ability. Humans are sexually dimorphic in body size, body structure, and body composition. Men tend to be taller and heavier than women, and adjusted for height, men tend to have greater lean and bone mass than women, and lower fat mass.[9]
Secondary sex characteristics are features that appear during puberty in humans.[10][11] Such features are especially evident in the sexually dimorphic phenotypic traits that distinguish between the sexes, but—unlike the primary sex characteristics—are not directly part of the reproductive system.[12][13][14] Secondary sexual characteristics that are specific to men include:
An enlarged larynx (also known as an Adam's apple);[15] and
A voice that is significantly deeper than the voice of a child or a woman.[13]
Men weigh more than women.[16] On average, men are taller than women by about 10%.[16] On average, men have a larger waist in comparison to their hips (see waist–hip ratio) than women. In women, the index and ring fingers tend to be either more similar in size or their index finger is slightly longer than their ring finger, whereas men's ring finger tends to be longer.[17]
The internal male genitalia consist of the testicles, which produce sperm, the accessory glands, which produce seminal fluid, the epididymides, which store sperm cells, and the vasa deferentia and ejaculatory ducts, which transfer the mature sperm to the urethra.
The external male genitalia consist of the penis and the scrotum, a pouch of skin housing the testicles.[18]
Sperm cells are ejaculated in semen through the penis and enter the female reproductive tract through the vagina. Sperm that pass from the vagina to the uterus can enter the fallopian tubes and fertilize an egg, which develops into an embryo. The study of male reproduction and associated organs is called andrology.[19]
Testosterone stimulates the development of the Wolffian ducts, the penis, and closure of the labioscrotal folds into the scrotum. Another significant hormone in sexual differentiation is the anti-Müllerian hormone, which inhibits the development of the Müllerian ducts. For males during puberty, testosterone, along with gonadotropins released by the pituitary gland, stimulates spermatogenesis.[20]

While a majority of the global health gender disparities is weighted against women, there are situations in which men tend to fare poorer. One such instance is armed conflicts, where men are often the immediate victims. A study of conflicts in 13 countries from 1955 to 2002 found that 81% of all violent war deaths were male.[21] Apart from armed conflicts, areas with high incidence of violence, such as regions controlled by drug cartels, also see men experiencing higher mortality rates.[22] This stems from social beliefs that associate ideals of masculinity with aggressive, confrontational behavior.[23] Lastly, sudden and drastic changes in economic environments and the loss of social safety nets, in particular social subsidies and food stamps, have also been linked to higher levels of alcohol consumption and psychological stress among men, leading to a spike in male mortality rates. This is because such situations often makes it harder for men to provide for their family, a task that has been long regarded as the "essence of masculinity."[24] A retrospective analyses of people infected with the common cold found that doctors underrate the symptoms of men, and are more willing to attribute symptoms and illness to women than men.[25] Women live longer than men in all countries, and across all age groups, for which reliable records exist.[26] In the United States, men are less healthy than women across all social classes. Non-white men are especially unhealthy. Men are over-represented in dangerous occupations and represent a majority of on the job deaths. Further, medical doctors provide men with less service, less advice, and spend less time with men than they do with women per medical encounter.[27]
Male sexuality and attraction varies between individuals, and a man's sexual behavior can be affected by many factors, including evolved predispositions, personality, upbringing, and culture. While most men are heterosexual, significant minorities are homosexual or bisexual.[28]
Most cultures use a gender binary in which man is one of the two genders, the other being woman.[29][30][31]
Most men are cisgender, and their gender identity aligns with their male sex assignment at birth. Trans men have a male gender identity that does not align with their female sex assignment at birth, and may undergo masculinizing hormone replacement therapy and/or sex reassignment surgery.[32] Intersex men may have sex characteristics that do not fit typical notions of male biology.[33] A 2016 systemic review estimated that 0.256% of people self-identify as female-to-male transgender.[34] A 2017 survey of 80,929 Minnesota students found that roughly twice as many female-assigned adolescents self-identified as transgender, compared to adolescents with a male sex assignment.[35]

Masculinity (also sometimes called manhood or manliness) is the set of personality traits and attributes associated with boys and men. Although masculinity is socially constructed,[36] some research indicates that some behaviors considered masculine are biologically influenced.[37] To what extent masculinity is biologically or socially influenced is subject to debate.[37] It is distinct from the definition of the biological male sex, as both males and females can exhibit masculine traits.[38] Men generally face social stigma for embodying feminine traits, more so than women do for embodying masculine traits.[39] This can also manifest as homophobia.[40]
Standards of manliness or masculinity vary across different cultures and historical periods.[41] While the outward signs of masculinity look different in different cultures, there are some common aspects to its definition across cultures. In all cultures in the past, and still among traditional and non-Western cultures, getting married is the most common and definitive distinction between boyhood and manhood.[42] In the late 20th century, some qualities traditionally associated with marriage (such as the "triple Ps" of protecting, providing, and procreating) were still considered signs of having achieved manhood.[42][43]
Platonic relationships are not significantly different between men and women, though some differences do exist. Friendships involving men tend to be based more on shared activities than self-disclosure and personal connection. Perceptions of friendship involving men varies among cultures and time periods.[44] In heterosexual romantic relationships, men are typically expected to take a proactive role, initiate the relationship, plan dates, and propose marriage.[45]
Anthropology has shown that masculinity itself has social status, just like wealth, race and social class. In Western culture, for example, greater masculinity usually brings greater social status.[46] Many English words such as virtue and virile (from the Indo-European root vir meaning man) reflect this.[47][48] In most cultures, male privilege allows men more rights and privileges than women. In societies where men are not given special legal privileges, they typically hold more positions of power, and men are seen as being taken more seriously in society.[46] This is associated with a "gender-role strain" in which men face increased societal pressure to conform to gender roles.[49]
The earliest known recorded name of a man in writing is potentially Kushim, who would have lived sometime between 3400 and 3000 BC in the Sumerian city of Uruk; though his name may have been a title rather than his actual name.[50] The earliest confirmed names are that of Gal-Sal and his two slaves named En-pap X and Sukkalgir, from c. 3100 BC.[51]
Men may have children, whether biological or adopted; such men are called fathers. The role of men in the family has shifted considerably in the 20th and 21st centuries, taking on a more active role in raising children in most societies.[52][53][54][55] Men would traditionally marry a woman when raising children, but in modern times many countries now allow for same-sex marriage, and for those couples to raise children either via adoption or surrogacy. Men may be single parents, and are increasingly so in modern times, though women are three times more likely to be single parents than men.[56] In paternal societies, men have typically have been regarded as the "head of household" and held additional social privileges.[57]
Men have traditionally held jobs that were not available to women. Such jobs tended to be either more strenuous, more prestigious, or more dangerous. Modern men increasingly take untraditional career paths, such as staying home and raising children while their partner works.[58] Modern men tend to work longer than women, which impacts their ability to spend time with their families.[59] Even in modern times, some jobs remain available only to men, such as military service.[60] Conscription is overwhelmingly discriminatory, currently only ten countries include women in their conscription programs.[61][62] Men continue to hold more dangerous jobs than women, even in developed countries. In the United States in 2020, ten times as many men died on the job as women.[63]
Media portrayals of men often replicate traditional understanding of masculinity. Men are portrayed more frequently in television than women and most commonly appear as leads in action and drama programming. Men are typically more active in television programming than women and typically hold more power and status. Due to their prominence, men are more likely to be both the objects and instigators of humorous or disparaging content. Fathers are often portrayed in television as either idealized and caring or clumsy and inept. In advertising, men are disproportionately featured in advertisements for alcohol, vehicles, and business products.[64]
Men's clothing typically encompasses a range of garments designed for various occasions, seasons, and styles. Fundamental items of a man's wardrobe include shirts, trousers, suits, and jackets, which are designed to provide both comfort and style while prioritizing functionality. Men's fashion also encompasses more casual garments such as t-shirts, sweatshirts, jeans, shorts, and swimwear, which are typically intended for informal settings. Cultural and regional traditions often influence men's fashion, resulting in diverse styles and garments that reflect the unique characteristics of different parts of the world.[65]
Men traditionally received more education than women as a result of single-sex education. Universal education, meaning state-provided primary and secondary education independent of gender, is not yet a global norm, even if it is assumed in most developed countries.[66][67] In the 21st century, the balance has shifted in many developed nations, and men now lag behind women in education.[68]
Men are more likely than women to be faculty at universities.[69]
In 2020, 90% of the world's men were literate, compared to 87% of women. But sub-Saharan Africa, and southwest Asia lagged behind the rest of the world; only 72% of men in sub-Saharan Africa were literate.[70]
In most societies, men have more legal and cultural rights than women,[46] and misogyny is far more prevalent than misandry in society.[71][72] However, there are exceptions to this generalization. While one in six males experience childhood sexual abuse,[73][74][75] men typically receive less support after being victims of it,[76] and rape of males is stigmatized.[77] Domestic violence against men is similarly stigmatized,[78] although men make up half of the victims in heterosexual couples.[79][80][81] Opponents of circumcision describe it as a human rights violation.[82] The fathers' rights movement seeks to support separated fathers that do not receive equal rights to care for their children.[83] The men's movement is the response to issues faced by men in Western countries. It includes pro-feminist groups such as the men's liberation movement,[84] and anti-feminist groups such as the manosphere.
The Mars symbol (♂) is a common symbol that represents the male sex.[85] The symbol is identical to the planetary symbol of Mars.[86] It was first used to denote sex by Carl Linnaeus in 1751.[87] The symbol is sometimes seen as a stylized representation of the shield and spear of the Roman god Mars. According to Stearn, however, this derivation is "fanciful" and all the historical evidence favours "the conclusion of the French classical scholar Claude de Saumaise" that it is derived from θρ, the contraction of a Greek epithet for Mars, θοῦρος (Thouros).[88]
^ Male may refer to sex or gender.[1] The plural men is sometimes used in certain phrases such as men's studies to denote male humans regardless of age.

Irrespective of their chromosomal constitution, when the gonadal primordia differentiate into testes, all internal and external genitalia develop following the male pathway. When no testes are present, the genitalia develop along the female pathway. The existence of ovaries has no effect on fetal differentiation of the genitalia. The paramount importance of testicular differentiation for fetal sex development has prompted the use of the expression "sex determination" to refer to the differentiation of the bipotential or primitive gonads into testes.

By Joshua N Updated on November 9, 2024 What defines a man today? It's not the same as it used to be. Discover how we've moved from traditional ideas of power and strength to valuing understanding and respect! Traditionally, traits like power, physical strength, and emotional restraint have defined masculinity. While these qualities are not inherently masculine, they have shaped the idea of what it means to be a man for a long time. However, just because a man can throw a punch or drink beer doesn't make him a true man. A real man is characterized by caring, compassion, and chivalry. So, How Has Our View Of Manhood Changed? Historically, a "man" was often seen as someone strong, able to provide for his family, emotionally reserved, and assertive. But, just like having a penis doesn't define a guy, neither does suppressing emotions or winning an arm-wrestling match. Today, many believe that a man who hides his feelings isn't a real man at all. This shift is important because traditional views of masculinity can be toxic. Consider a father who never hugs his son and tells him that boys shouldn't cry; that's not a model to look up to. Instead, a father who encourages his son to express his feelings and work through them is a true role model of manhood. The old ideals promote aggression, violence, and toxic masculinity, often stemming from the fear of appearing weak or feminine. Many men's greatest fear is being seen as less masculine, which is a problem in itself. If men learn to feel secure in their masculinity by sharing emotions and respecting others, we can break away from these outdated views. What Makes A Man A Man Today? Traditional masculinity is no longer relevant. Modern masculinity is about caring for mental health and fostering deeper connections. Now, let's explore the specific traits that define a true man. 1. He Is Confident In His Masculinity And Sexuality A real man is secure in his masculinity and doesn't need others to confirm it. He knows who he is and feels comfortable being himself, regardless of what others think. He doesn't feel the need to show off his muscles or brag about his past relationships. Instead, he is humble and down-to-earth. 2. He Respects Women What makes a man a man is how he treats women. This respect goes beyond just his mother or sister; he respects all women, whether he finds them attractive or not. He doesn't talk down to women, objectify them, or assume they need his help. 3. He Isn't Afraid To Share Power A true man understands the importance of letting go of power. In the past, women faced barriers in the workplace, but now it's common for men to have female bosses. This doesn't make a man weak; it shows strength. He can step back, listen to women, and let others speak. A real man doesn't need to be the center of attention or control every situation. 4. He Always Offers To Help A true gentleman always offers help without assuming it's needed. He will hold the door open, assist you up the stairs, or pull out your chair. If you decline his offer, he won't get upset. He is ready to help anyone who needs it, not just women. If another man needs assistance, he will gladly lend a hand. 5. He Calls Out Other Men This trait is often overlooked but is very important. While women often discuss men who treat them poorly, men need to speak up too. What defines a true man is his ability to call out other men on bad behavior. He will set aside his pride and the so-called "bro code" to challenge sexism, blatant misogyny, and inappropriate actions, all because he respects women. 6. He Believes Women A true gentleman listens and believes women when they express discomfort, say they don't want a drink, mention they have a boyfriend, or share experiences of assault. He respects their words without questioning them or needing proof. He never pushes boundaries, uses peer pressure, or tries to charm them. 7. He Admits When He's Wrong Men who cling to outdated views of masculinity often struggle to admit when they're wrong. They may blame others, lie, or do anything to avoid losing face. What defines a real man is his ability to acknowledge his mistakes. Being humble and accepting responsibility is a clear sign of maturity. 8. He Appreciates Others Many men don't recognize their privilege in society. Regardless of the issue, they often hold more power than women, which isn't due to a lack of effort on women's part. A true man appreciates everyone who has helped him along the way. He values the women in his life and those before them, respects people in the service industry, and treats everyone with dignity because he understands that no one is better than anyone else. 9. He's A Feminist Many men hesitate to identify as feminists due to misconceptions that it involves hating men or believing women are superior. However, feminism is about equality, and a true man understands this. He knows that women and men deserve equal rights, respect, opportunities, and pay. 10. He Can Laugh At Himself A real man possesses humility and can laugh at himself. He isn't easily embarrassed and doesn't take jokes personally. While he knows when to be serious, he always makes time for laughter, especially if it's at his own expense. 11. He Is Always Learning A true sign of masculinity is the desire to keep learning. A real man listens and seeks to know more but never thinks he is the smartest person in the room. He is open to new experiences, values different opinions, and welcomes new information. Most importantly, he doesn't act like a know-it-all and never points out someone else's mistakes to make them feel bad. 12. He Owns Up To His Faults A real man can admit his weaknesses. He is self-aware and willing to improve himself, and he doesn't claim to be perfect. Men who cling to traditional ideas of masculinity often become rigid and think they know best in every situation. Thankfully, modern masculinity is more flexible. Real men don't feel the need to have the final say; instead, they acknowledge that they don't know everything and that others may have valuable insights. 13. He Keeps His Word What defines a man today is his ability to keep his promises. A true man doesn't make commitments he has no intention of fulfilling. He stays true to himself and is always honest. 14. He Takes Pride In Responsibility The traditional view of masculinity values hard work and responsibility, and this still holds true. A good man enjoys caring for his loved ones. He takes pride in providing for his family and feels fulfilled knowing he has worked hard to achieve his goals and make his family and friends proud. 15. He Prioritizes Mental Health A key aspect of modern masculinity is taking care of mental health. In the past, boys were taught not to cry and to hide their emotions. Anger seemed to be the only acceptable emotion for them. Now, understanding and expressing emotions is encouraged and seen as healthy. More men are becoming aware of their thoughts and feelings, and many are participating in therapy. Knowing how to recognize and express emotions effectively is a valuable skill for everyone! 16. He Nourishes Rewarding Relationships Today, we understand how toxic relationships can harm a person. True modern men focus on building healthy relationships with themselves and others. They recognize the importance of nurturing connections that are positive and supportive. 17. He Cares About His Physical Health While men have always been associated with strength, the focus has shifted from just building muscle to overall health. Instead of only trying to bulk up, modern men pay attention to their overall physical well-being. They are mindful of what they eat and balance exercise with healthy habits, caring more about their health in general. 18. He Challenges Himself Modern men are committed to personal growth. They actively seek new challenges and step outside their comfort zones. They push themselves to learn more, do more, and grow more. They enjoy exploring new ideas and places, always looking to expand their limits for personal development. 19. He Respects Everybody A real gentleman shows respect to everyone. He treats all people with kindness, regardless of gender, age, or lifestyle. Modern men are respectful toward other men, women, and children alike, promoting an inclusive and respectful environment. 20. He's Ambitious A true man knows how to set goals and work hard to achieve them. He is always striving for self-improvement and is willing to put in the effort to succeed. He is not afraid of hard work or the time it takes to reach his goals because he has the inner drive to accomplish them. There's more than one way to be masculine, but these traits provide a strong foundation. What makes a man a man is building on these principles and growing from them.

The breasts are two prominences located on the upper ventral region of the torso among humans and other primates. Both sexes develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. The relative size and development of the breasts is a major secondary sex distinction between females and males. There is also considerable variation in size between individuals. Permanent breast growth during puberty is caused by estrogens in conjunction with the growth hormone. Female humans are the only mammals that permanently develop breasts at puberty; all other mammals develop their mammary tissue during the latter period of pregnancy.
In females, the breast serves as the mammary gland, which produces and secretes milk to feed infants.[2] Subcutaneous fat covers and envelops a network of ducts that converge on the nipple, and these tissues give the breast its distinct size and globular shape. At the ends of the ducts are lobules, or clusters of alveoli, where milk is produced and stored in response to hormonal signals.[3] During pregnancy, the breast responds to a complex interaction of hormones, including estrogens, progesterone, and prolactin, that mediate the completion of its development, namely lobuloalveolar maturation, in preparation of lactation and breastfeeding.
Along with their major function in providing nutrition for infants, breasts can figure prominently in the perception of a woman's body and sexual attractiveness. Breasts, especially the nipples, can be an erogenous zone, and part of sexual activity. Some cultures ascribe social and sexual characteristics to female breasts, and may regard bare breasts in public as immodest or indecent. Breasts can represent fertility, femininity, or abundance. Breasts have been featured in ancient and modern sculpture, art, and photography.
The English word breast derives from the Old English word brēost 'breast, bosom' from Proto-Germanic *breustam 'breast', from the Proto-Indo-European base *bhreus– 'to swell, to sprout'.[4] The breast spelling conforms to the Scottish and North English dialectal pronunciations.[5] The Merriam-Webster Dictionary states that "Middle English brest, [comes] from Old English brēost; akin to Old High German brust..., Old Irish brú [belly], [and] Russian bryukho"; the first known usage of the term was before the 12th century.[6]
Breasts is often used to refer to female breasts in particular, though the stricter anatomical term refers to the same region on members of either sex. Male breasts are sometimes referred to in the singular to mean the collective upper chest area,[a] whereas female breasts are referred to in the plural unless speaking of a specific left or right breast.
A large number of colloquial terms for female breasts are used in English, ranging from fairly polite terms to vulgar or slang.[b] Some vulgar slang expressions may be considered to be derogatory or sexist to women.[7]
Humans are the only mammals whose breasts become permanently enlarged after sexual maturity (known in humans as puberty). The reason for this evolutionary change is unknown.[8] Several hypotheses have been put forward:
A link has been proposed to processes for synthesizing the endogenous steroid hormone precursor dehydroepiandrosterone which takes place in fat rich regions of the body like the buttocks and breasts. These contributed to human brain development and played a part in increasing brain size. Breast enlargement may for this purpose have occurred as early as Homo ergaster (1.7–1.4 MYA).[9] Other breast formation hypotheses may have then taken over as principal drivers.[10][11][9]
It has been suggested by zoologists Avishag and Amotz Zahavi that the size of the human breasts can be explained by the handicap theory of sexual dimorphism. This would see the explanation for larger breasts as them being an honest display of the women's health and ability to grow and carry them in her life. Prospective mates can then evaluate the genes of a potential mate for their ability to sustain her health even with the additional energy demanding burden she is carrying.[12][13]
The zoologist Desmond Morris describes a sociobiological approach in his science book The Naked Ape. He suggests, by making comparisons with the other primates, that breasts evolved to replace swelling buttocks as a sex signal of ovulation. He notes how humans have, relatively speaking, large penises as well as large breasts. Furthermore, early humans adopted bipedalism and face-to-face coitus. He therefore suggested enlarged sexual signals helped maintain the bond between a mated male and female even though they performed different duties and therefore were separated for lengths of time.[14][13][15]
A 2001 study proposed that the rounded shape of a woman's breast evolved to prevent the sucking infant offspring from suffocating while feeding at the teat; that is, because of the human infant's small jaw, which did not project from the face to reach the nipple, they might block the nostrils against the mother's breast if it were of a flatter form (compare with the common chimpanzee). Theoretically, as the human jaw receded into the face, the woman's body compensated with round breasts.[16]
Ashley Montagu (1965) proposed that breasts came about as an adaptation for infant feeding for a different reason, as early human ancestors adopted bipedalism and the loss of body hair. Human upright stance meant infants must be carried at the hip or shoulder instead of on the back as in the apes. This gives the infant less opportunity to find the nipple or the purchase to cling on to the mother's body hair. The mobility of the nipple on a large breast in most human females gives the infant more ability to find it, grasp it and feed.[11]
Other suggestions include simply that permanent breasts attracted mates, that "pendulous" breasts gave infants something to cling to, or that permanent breasts shared the function of a camel's hump, to store fat as an energy reserve.[8]
In women, the breasts overlie the pectoralis major muscles and extend on average from the level of the second rib to the level of the sixth rib in the front of the rib cage; thus, the breasts cover much of the chest area and the chest walls. At the front of the chest, the breast tissue can extend from the clavicle (collarbone) to the middle of the sternum (breastbone). At the sides of the chest, the breast tissue can extend into the axilla (armpit), and can reach as far to the back as the latissimus dorsi muscle, extending from the lower back to the humerus bone (the bone of the upper arm). As a mammary gland, the breast is composed of differing layers of tissue, predominantly two types: adipose tissue; and glandular tissue, which affects the lactation functions of the breasts.[17]: 115 The natural resonant frequency of the human breast is about 2 hertz.[18]
Morphologically, the breast is tear-shaped.[19] The superficial tissue layer (superficial fascia) is separated from the skin by 0.5–2.5 cm of subcutaneous fat (adipose tissue). The suspensory Cooper's ligaments are fibrous-tissue prolongations that radiate from the superficial fascia to the skin envelope. The female adult breast contains 14–18 irregular lactiferous lobes that converge at the nipple. The 2.0–4.5 mm milk ducts are immediately surrounded with dense connective tissue that support the glands. Milk exits the breast through the nipple, which is surrounded by a pigmented area of skin called the areola. The size of the areola can vary widely among women. The areola contains modified sweat glands known as Montgomery's glands. These glands secrete oily fluid that lubricate and protect the nipple during breastfeeding.[20] Volatile compounds in these secretions may also serve as an olfactory stimulus for the newborn's appetite.[21]
The dimensions and weight of the breast vary widely among women. A small-to-medium-sized breast weighs 500 grams (1.1 pounds) or less, and a large breast can weigh approximately 750 to 1,000 grams (1.7 to 2.2 pounds) or more. In terms of composition, the breasts are about 80 to 90% stromal tissue (fat and connective tissue), while epithelial or glandular tissue only accounts for about 10 to 20% of the volume of the breasts.[22][23][24][25][26] The tissue composition ratios of the breast also vary among women. Some women's breasts have a higher proportion of glandular tissue than of adipose or connective tissues. The fat-to-connective-tissue ratio determines the density or firmness of the breast. During a woman's life, her breasts change size, shape, and weight due to hormonal changes during puberty, the menstrual cycle, pregnancy, breastfeeding, and menopause.[27][28]
The breast is an apocrine gland that produces the milk used to feed an infant. The nipple of the breast is surrounded by the areola (nipple-areola complex). The areola has many sebaceous glands, and the skin color varies from pink to dark brown. The basic units of the breast are the terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), which produce the fatty breast milk. They give the breast its offspring-feeding functions as a mammary gland. They are distributed throughout the body of the breast. Approximately two-thirds of the lactiferous tissue is within 30 mm of the base of the nipple. The terminal lactiferous ducts drain the milk from TDLUs into 4–18 lactiferous ducts, which drain to the nipple. The milk-glands-to-fat ratio is 2:1 in a lactating woman, and 1:1 in a non-lactating woman. In addition to the milk glands, the breast is also composed of connective tissues (collagen, elastin), white fat, and the suspensory Cooper's ligaments. Sensation in the breast is provided by the peripheral nervous system innervation by means of the front (anterior) and side (lateral) cutaneous branches of the fourth-, fifth-, and sixth intercostal nerves. The T-4 nerve (Thoracic spinal nerve 4), which innervates the dermatomic area, supplies sensation to the nipple-areola complex.[29]
Approximately 75% of the lymph from the breast travels to the axillary lymph nodes on the same side of the body, while 25% of the lymph travels to the parasternal nodes (beside the sternum bone).[17]: 116 A small amount of remaining lymph travels to the other breast and to the abdominal lymph nodes. The subareolar region has a lymphatic plexus known as the "subareolar plexus of Sappey".[30] The axillary lymph nodes include the pectoral (chest), subscapular (under the scapula), and humeral (humerus-bone area) lymph-node groups, which drain to the central axillary lymph nodes and to the apical axillary lymph nodes. The lymphatic drainage of the breasts is especially relevant to oncology because breast cancer is common to the mammary gland, and cancer cells can metastasize (break away) from a tumor and be dispersed to other parts of the body by means of the lymphatic system.
The morphologic variations in the size, shape, volume, tissue density, pectoral locale, and spacing of the breasts determine their natural shape, appearance, and position on a woman's chest. Breast size and other characteristics do not predict the fat-to-milk-gland ratio or the potential for the woman to nurse an infant. The size and the shape of the breasts are influenced by normal-life hormonal changes (thelarche, menstruation, pregnancy, menopause) and medical conditions (e.g. virginal breast hypertrophy).[31] The shape of the breasts is naturally determined by the support of the suspensory Cooper's ligaments, the underlying muscle and bone structures of the chest, and by the skin envelope. The suspensory ligaments sustain the breast from the clavicle (collarbone) and the clavico-pectoral fascia (collarbone and chest) by traversing and encompassing the fat and milk-gland tissues. The breast is positioned, affixed to, and supported upon the chest wall, while its shape is established and maintained by the skin envelope.[32][33] In most women, one breast is slightly larger than the other.[19] More obvious and persistent asymmetry in breast size occurs in up to 25% of women.[34]
The base of each breast is attached to the chest by the deep fascia over the pectoralis major muscles. The base of the breast is semi-circular, however the shape and position of the breast above the surface is variable.[35] The space between the breast and the pectoralis major muscle, called retromammary space, gives mobility to the breast. The chest (thoracic cavity) progressively slopes outwards from the thoracic inlet (atop the breastbone) and above to the lowest ribs that support the breasts. The inframammary fold (IMF), where the lower portion of the breast meets the chest, is an anatomic feature created by the adherence of the breast skin and the underlying connective tissues of the chest; the IMF is the lower-most extent of the anatomic breast. Normal breast tissue has a texture that feels nodular or granular, with considerable variation from woman to woman.[19]
Breasts have been categorized into four general morphological groups: "flat, spheric, protruded, and drooped", or "small/flat, large/inward, upward, and droopy".[36][37][38]
While it is a common belief that breastfeeding causes breasts to sag,[39] researchers have found that a woman's breasts sag due to four key factors: cigarette smoking, number of pregnancies, gravity, and weight loss or gain.[40] Women sometimes wear bras because they mistakenly believe they prevent breasts from sagging as they get older.[41] Physicians, lingerie retailers, teenagers, and adult women used to believe that bras were medically required to support breasts. In a 1952 article in Parents' Magazine, Frank H. Crowell erroneously reported that it was important for teen girls to begin wearing bras early. According to Crowell, this would prevent sagging breasts, stretched blood vessels, and poor circulation later on.[42] This belief was based on the false idea that breasts cannot anatomically support themselves.[41][43]
Sports bras are sometimes used for cardiovascular exercise, sports bras are designed to secure the breasts closely to the body to prevent movement during high-motion activity such as running. Studies have indicated sports bras which are overly tight may restrict respiratory function.[44][45]
The breasts are principally composed of adipose, glandular, and connective tissues.[46] Because these tissues have hormone receptors,[46][47] their sizes and volumes fluctuate according to the hormonal changes particular to thelarche (sprouting of breasts), menstruation (egg production), pregnancy (reproduction), lactation (feeding of offspring), and menopause (end of menstruation).
The morphological structure of the human breast is identical in males and females until puberty. For pubescent girls in thelarche (the breast-development stage), the female sex hormones (principally estrogens) in conjunction with growth hormone promote the sprouting, growth, and development of the breasts. During this time, the mammary glands grow in size and volume and begin resting on the chest. These development stages of secondary sex characteristics (breasts, pubic hair, etc.) are illustrated in the five-stage Tanner scale.[48]
During thelarche, the developing breasts are sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is transitory and statistically normal in female physical and sexual development.[49] Medical conditions can cause overdevelopment (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, macromastia) or underdevelopment (e.g., tuberous breast deformity, micromastia) in girls and women.
Approximately two years after the onset of puberty (a girl's first menstrual cycle), estrogen and growth hormone stimulate the development and growth of the glandular fat and suspensory tissues that compose the breast. This continues for approximately four years until the final shape of the breast (size, volume, density) is established at about the age of 21. Mammoplasia (breast enlargement) in girls begins at puberty, unlike all other primates, in which breasts enlarge only during lactation.[20]
Hormone replacement therapy, including gender-affirming hormone therapy, stimulates the growth of glandular and adipose tissue through estrogen supplementation.[50]
In menopausal women, HRT helps restore breast volume and skin elasticity diminished by declining estrogen levels, typically using oral or transdermal estradiol.[51]
In gender-affirming hormone therapy, breast development is induced through feminizing HRT, often combining estrogen with anti-androgens to suppress testosterone. Maximum growth is usually achieved after 2–3 years.[52][53][54]
Factors such as age, genetics, and hormone dosage influence outcomes.
During the menstrual cycle, the breasts are enlarged by premenstrual water retention and temporary growth as influenced by changing hormone levels.[55]
The breasts reach full maturity only when a woman's first pregnancy occurs.[56] Changes to the breasts are among the first signs of pregnancy. The breasts become larger, the nipple-areola complex becomes larger and darker, the Montgomery's glands enlarge, and veins sometimes become more visible. Breast tenderness during pregnancy is common, especially during the first trimester. By mid-pregnancy, the breast is physiologically capable of lactation and some women can express colostrum, a form of breast milk.[57]
Pregnancy causes elevated levels of the hormone prolactin, which has a key role in the production of milk. However, milk production is blocked by the hormones progesterone and estrogen until after delivery, when progesterone and estrogen levels plummet.[58]
At menopause, breast atrophy occurs.[59] The breasts can decrease in size when the levels of circulating estrogen decline. The adipose tissue and milk glands also begin to wither. The breasts can also become enlarged from adverse side effects of combined oral contraceptive pills. The size of the breasts can also increase and decrease in response to weight fluctuations.[60]
Physical changes to the breasts are often recorded in the stretch marks of the skin envelope; they can serve as historical indicators of the increments and the decrements of the size and volume of a woman's breasts throughout the course of her life.[verification needed]
Breast changes during menopause are sometimes treated with hormone replacement therapy.[61]
Breast cancer is a cancer that develops from breast tissue.[62] Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, milk rejection, fluid coming from the nipple, a newly inverted nipple, or a red or scaly patch of skin.[63] In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin.[64]
Risk factors for developing breast cancer include obesity, a lack of physical exercise, alcohol consumption, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, an early age at first menstruation, having children late in life (or not at all), older age, having a prior history of breast cancer, and a family history of breast cancer.[63][65][66] About five to ten percent of cases are the result of an inherited genetic predisposition,[63] including BRCA mutations among others.[63] Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply these ducts with milk.[63] Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas.[63] There are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer.[65] Some, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions.[65] The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning tissue.[63] Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are carried out to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments are most likely to be effective.[63]
The primary function of the breasts, as mammary glands, is the nourishing of an infant with breast milk. Milk is produced in milk-secreting cells in the alveoli. When the breasts are stimulated by the suckling of her baby, the mother's brain secretes oxytocin. High levels of oxytocin trigger the contraction of muscle cells surrounding the alveoli, causing milk to flow along the ducts that connect the alveoli to the nipple.[58]
Full-term newborns have an instinct and a need to suck on a nipple, and breastfed babies nurse for both nutrition and for comfort.[67] Breast milk provides all necessary nutrients for the first six months of life, and then remains an important source of nutrition, alongside solid foods, until at least one or two years of age.
Biomechanical studies have demonstrated that, depending on the activity and the size of a woman's breast, when she walks or runs braless, her breasts may move up and down by 4 to 18 centimetres (1.6 to 7.1 in) or more, and also oscillate side to side.[68] Researchers have also found that as women's breast size increased, they took part in less physical activity, especially vigorous exercise. Few very-large-breasted women jogged, for example. To avoid exercise-related discomfort and pain, medical experts suggest women wear a well-fitted sports bra during activity.[68]
The breast is susceptible to numerous benign and malignant conditions. The most frequent benign conditions are puerperal mastitis, fibrocystic breast changes and mastalgia.
Lactation unrelated to pregnancy is known as galactorrhea. It can be caused by certain drugs (such as antipsychotic medications), extreme physical stress, or endocrine disorders. Lactation in newborns is caused by hormones from the mother that crossed into the baby's bloodstream during pregnancy.
Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death among women[69] and it is one of the leading causes of death among women. Factors that appear to be implicated in decreasing the risk of breast cancer are regular breast examinations by health care professionals, regular mammograms, self-examination of breasts, healthy diet, exercise to decrease excess body fat,[70] and breastfeeding.[71]
Both females and males develop breasts from the same embryological tissues. Anatomically, male breasts do not normally contain lobules and acini that are present in females. In rare instances, it is possible for very few lobules to be present; this makes it possible for some men to develop lobular carcinoma of the breast.[72] Normally, males produce lower levels of estrogens and higher levels of androgens, namely testosterone, which suppress the effects of estrogens in developing excessive breast tissue. In boys and men, abnormal breast development is manifested as gynecomastia, the consequence of a biochemical imbalance between the normal levels of estrogen and testosterone in the male body.[73] Around 70% of boys temporarily develop breast tissue during adolescence.[34] The condition usually resolves by itself within two years.[34] When male lactation occurs, it is considered a symptom of a disorder of the pituitary gland.
Plastic surgery can be performed to augment or reduce the size of breasts, or to reconstruct the breast in cases of deformative disease, such as breast cancer.[74] Breast augmentation and breast lift (mastopexy) procedures are done only for cosmetic reasons, whereas breast reduction is sometimes medically indicated.[19] In cases where a woman's breasts are severely asymmetrical, surgery can be performed to either enlarge the smaller breast, reduce the size of the larger breast, or both.[19]
Breast augmentation surgery generally does not interfere with future ability to breastfeed.[75] Breast reduction surgery more frequently leads to decreased sensation in the nipple-areola complex, and to low milk supply in women who choose to breastfeed.[75] Implants can interfere with mammography (breast x-ray images).
In Christian iconography, some works of art depict women with their breasts in their hands or on a platter, signifying that they died as a martyr by having their breasts severed; one example of this is Saint Agatha of Sicily.[76]
Femen is a feminist activist group which uses topless protests as part of their campaigns against sex tourism[77][78] religious institutions,[79] sexism, and homophobia.[80] Femen activists have been regularly detained by police in response to their protests.[81]
There is a long history of female breasts being used by comedians as a subject for comedy fodder (e.g., British comic Benny Hill's burlesque/slapstick routines).[82]
In European pre-historic societies, sculptures of female figures with pronounced or highly exaggerated breasts were common. A typical example is the so-called Venus of Willendorf, one of many Paleolithic Venus figurines with ample hips and bosom. Artifacts such as bowls, rock carvings and sacred statues with breasts have been recorded from 15,000 BC up to late antiquity all across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.
Many female deities representing love and fertility were associated with breasts and breast milk. Figures of the Phoenician goddess Astarte were represented as pillars studded with breasts. Isis, an Egyptian goddess who represented, among many other things, ideal motherhood, was often portrayed as suckling pharaohs, thereby confirming their divine status as rulers. Even certain male deities representing regeneration and fertility were occasionally depicted with breast-like appendices, such as the river god Hapy who was considered to be responsible for the annual overflowing of the Nile.
Female breasts were also prominent in Minoan art in the form of the famous Snake Goddess statuettes, and a few other pieces, though most female breasts are covered. In Ancient Greece there were several cults worshipping the "Kourotrophos", the suckling mother, represented by goddesses such as Gaia, Hera and Artemis. The worship of deities symbolized by the female breast in Greece became less common during the first millennium. The popular adoration of female goddesses decreased significantly during the rise of the Greek city states, a legacy which was passed on to the later Roman Empire.[83]
During the middle of the first millennium BC, Greek culture experienced a gradual change in the perception of female breasts. Women in art were covered in clothing from the neck down, including female goddesses like Athena, the patron of Athens who represented heroic endeavor. There were exceptions: Aphrodite, the goddess of love, was more frequently portrayed fully nude, though in postures that were intended to portray shyness or modesty, a portrayal that has been compared to modern pin ups by historian Marilyn Yalom.[84] Although nude men were depicted standing upright, most depictions of female nudity in Greek art occurred "usually with drapery near at hand and with a forward-bending, self-protecting posture".[85] A popular legend at the time was of the Amazons, a tribe of fierce female warriors who socialized with men only for procreation and even removed one breast to become better warriors (the idea being that the right breast would interfere with the operation of a bow and arrow). The legend was a popular motif in art during Greek and Roman antiquity and served as an antithetical cautionary tale.
Many women regard their breasts as important to their sexual attractiveness, as a sign of femininity that is important to their sense of self. A woman with smaller breasts may regard her breasts as less attractive.[86]
Because breasts are mostly fatty tissue, their shape can—within limits—be molded by clothing, such as foundation garments. Bras are commonly worn by about 90% of Western women,[87][88][89] and are often worn for support.[90] The social norm in most Western cultures is to cover breasts in public, though the extent of coverage varies depending on the social context. Some religions ascribe a special status to the female breast, either in formal teachings or through symbolism.[91] Islam forbids free women from exposing their breasts in public.
Many cultures, including Western cultures in North America, associate breasts with sexuality and tend to regard bare breasts as immodest or indecent. In some cultures, like the Himba in northern Namibia, bare-breasted women are normal. In some African cultures, for example, the thigh is regarded as highly sexualized and never exposed in public, but breast exposure is not taboo. In a few Western countries and regions female toplessness at a beach is acceptable, although it may not be acceptable in the town center.[92]
Social attitudes and laws regarding breastfeeding in public vary widely. In many countries, breastfeeding in public is common, legally protected, and generally not regarded as an issue. However, even though the practice may be legal or socially accepted, some mothers may nevertheless be reluctant to expose a breast in public to breastfeed[93][94] due to actual or potential objections by other people, negative comments, or harassment.[95] It is estimated that around 63% of mothers across the world have publicly breast-fed.[96] Bare-breasted women are legal and culturally acceptable at public beaches in Australia and much of Europe.[97][92] Filmmaker Lina Esco made a film entitled Free the Nipple, which is about "...laws against female toplessness or restrictions on images of female, but not male, nipples", which Esco states is an example of sexism in society.[82]
Breast binding, also known as chest binding, is the flattening and hiding of breasts with constrictive materials such as cloth strips or purpose-built undergarments. Binders may also be used as alternatives to bras or for reasons of propriety. People who bind include women, trans men, non-binary people, and cisgender men with gynecomastia.
In some cultures, breasts play a role in human sexual activity. Breasts and especially the nipples are among the various human erogenous zones. They are sensitive to the touch as they have many nerve endings; and it is common to press or massage them with hands or orally before or during sexual activity. During sexual arousal, breast size increases, venous patterns across the breasts become more visible, and nipples harden.[citation needed] Compared to other primates, human breasts are proportionately large throughout adult females' lives. Some writers have suggested that they may have evolved as a visual signal of sexual maturity and fertility.[98] In Patterns of Sexual Behavior, a 1951 analysis of 191 traditional cultures, the researchers noted that stimulation of the female breast by a male sexual partner "seemed absent in all subhuman forms, although it is common among the members of many different human societies."[99]
Many people regard bare female breasts to be aesthetically pleasing or erotic, and they can elicit heightened sexual desires in men in many cultures. In the ancient Indian work the Kama Sutra, light scratching of the breasts with nails and biting with teeth are considered erotic.[100] Some people show a sexual interest in female breasts distinct from that of the person, which may be regarded as a breast fetish.[101] A number of Western fashions include clothing which accentuate the breasts, such as the use of push-up bras and decollete (plunging neckline) gowns and blouses which show cleavage. While U.S. culture prefers breasts that are youthful and upright, some cultures venerate women with drooping breasts, indicating mothering and the wisdom of experience.[102]
Research conducted at the Victoria University of Wellington showed that breasts are often the first thing men look at, and for a longer time than other body parts.[103] The writers of the study had initially speculated that the reason for this is due to endocrinology with larger breasts indicating higher levels of estrogen and a sign of greater fertility,[103][104] but the researchers said that "Men may be looking more often at the breasts because they are simply aesthetically pleasing, regardless of the size."[103]
Some women report achieving an orgasm from nipple stimulation, but this is rare.[105][106] Research suggests that the orgasms are genital orgasms, and may also be directly linked to "the genital area of the brain". In these cases, it seems that sensation from the nipples travels to the same part of the brain as sensations from the vagina, clitoris and cervix. Nipple stimulation may trigger uterine contractions, which then produce a sensation in the genital area of the brain.[107][108][109]
There are many mountains named after the breast because they resemble it in appearance and so are objects of religious and ancestral veneration as a fertility symbol and of well-being. In Asia, there was "Breast Mountain", which had a cave where the Buddhist monk Bodhidharma (Da Mo) spent much time in meditation.[110] Other such breast mountains are Mount Elgon on the Uganda–Kenya border; Beinn Chìochan and the Maiden Paps in Scotland; the Bundok ng Susong Dalaga ('Maiden's breast mountains') in Talim Island, Philippines, the twin hills known as the Paps of Anu (Dá Chích Anann or 'the breasts of Anu'), near Killarney in Ireland; the 2,086 m high Tetica de Bacares or La Tetica in the Sierra de Los Filabres, Spain; Khao Nom Sao in Thailand, Cerro Las Tetas in Puerto Rico; and the Breasts of Aphrodite in Mykonos, among many others. In the United States, the Teton Range is named after the French word for 'nipple'.[111]
The maturation and size of the breasts can be measured by a variety of different methods. These include Tanner staging, bra cup size, breast volume, breast–chest difference, the breast unit, breast hemicircumference, and breast circumference, among other measures.

Estrogen stimulates the nipples to grow, mammary terminal duct branching to progress to the stage at which ductules are formed, and fatty stromal growth to increase until it constitutes about 85% of the mass of the breast. [...] Lobulation appears around menarche, when multiple blind saccular buds form by branching of the terminal ducts. These effects are due to the presence of progesterone. [...] Full alveolar development normally only occurs during pregnancy under the influence of additional progesterone and prolactin.

Along with the glandular growth, there is an increase in the amount of fibrous and fatty tissue, and in fact these latter two constituents of the breast account for a far greater proportion of the morphologic growth than the proportion contributed by glandular tissue. In the nonlactating adult breast, glandular tissue accounts for no more than 20% of the breast volume, and often much less than this, and the morphologic changes at puberty are therefore mainly due to stromal expansion.

History Short: Helicopters, Flight of Fancy or Fatality?
History Short: Sports Does NOT Equal Sportsmanship!
A Brief HistoryOn October 1, 1985, the United States began celebrating National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, founded by The American Cancer Society and Imperial Chemical Industries (later to become AstraZeneca). In honor of this extremely important focus on one of the worst killers of women, today we will list 10 women famous for their breasts, with a definite nod to the other, more important qualities these women possess. Previously on October 1st we ran an article called A Timeline of Breasts, listing many incidents in history where a woman’s breasts took center stage.Digging Deeper1. Jayne Mansfield, actress.The prototypical “dumb blonde,” Jayne was actually highly intelligent with an IQ of 163 and fluent in 5 languages. Jayne also played the violin and was an accomplished singer as well. Her measurements of 40-21-35 got most of the attention thrown her way, but even without that stunning build she would still be one heck of a woman. There is a famous picture where actress Sofia Loren is looking down at Jayne’s cleavage, with what seems to be envy in her eyes! (Miss Loren was fairly well endowed herself.) In 1963, Jayne became the first major Hollywood actress to appear nude in a film, Promises! Promises!.2. Mae West, actress.Mae West’s bosom was so famous that the military life jacket of World War II was called the “Mae West” as the bulky flotation portion of the vest fit over one’s chest giving the appearance of inflatable breasts. Far from just another sex symbol actress, West also produced, wrote screenplays, sang, and was an accomplished comedian. Unlike some get rich quick celebrities, West was intelligent with her money and invested wisely, never running out of cash. Often stifled by the censorship of the day, her dialogue in movies was limited to suit the prudish rules Hollywood lived by. She was less restricted on the nightclub circuit, where her singing and bawdy comedy won her acclaim.3. Dolly Parton, singer/songwriter.Not just another pretty face atop a massive bosom, Parton not only writes and sings songs, but also has acted in major motion pictures, produced, and is an astute businesswoman and investor. On top of that, she is also a philanthropist, author, plays several instruments, and has won 9 Grammy Awards (47 nominations) and was twice nominated for an Oscar. (She has numerous other awards.) Born in 1946, Parton as a child lived in a one room cabin in Tennessee (for real!). Perhaps the wealthiest Country Music star, Parton went from abject poverty as a child to a fortune of $650 million. She has had only one husband and has been married over 50 years. Dolly is so closely associated with breasts due to her 36DD cup size (41 inch bust), that the first sheep cloned from the mammary gland of a ewe was named “Dolly.” Another fun fact, Dolly is the Godmother of Miley Cyrus. Despite intense campaigning by Playboy Magazine, Dolly refused to ever pose nude or topless, although she did grace the cover of a 1978 edition of the magazine wearing a bunny outfit, complete with ears.4. Jane Russell, actress, singer.Jane was famously signed to a movie contract by billionaire Howard Hughes in 1940, and made her debut in the 1943 western, The Outlaw, in which the film makers took every opportunity to show off Russell’s curvaceous figure. The film was actually made in 1941, but once again the idiotic breastophobic censors of Hollywood were appalled by the cleavage revealed by Jane’s wardrobe. At 5’7” and sporting measurements of 38D-24-36, Russell quickly became a Hollywood sex symbol. Illustrating just how “prominent” Jane’s bust was to her public image, Bob Hope said as he introduced her, “The two and only Jane Russell.” Hope joked about trying to describe Jane without using one’s hands. Howard Hughes also had a memorable quote about Jane’s film attractiveness, “There are two good reasons why men go to see her.” Jane’s first husband, Bob Waterfield, who impregnated her when she was only 18, went on to become an All-American football star at UCLA and an NFL quarterback for the Cleveland (and then Los Angeles) Rams, eventually being enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. Russell also performed as a singer and in her younger years as a model, while later in life became active as a supporter of the Republican Party.5. Elvira, Mistress of the Dark.Actually, Cassandra Peterson, born in 1951 in Kansas and brought up in Colorado, as a girl was fascinated by all things related to horror. While still in high school, Cassandra danced as a go-go dancer at a Gay bar. Elvira, while still Cassandra, found work after high school dancing as a Las Vegas show girl, where she met Elvis Presley and even dated the King for a while. She got bit parts in a couple movies, and appeared on the cover of a Tom Waits record album, while also posing for nude magazines. Peterson sang with a rock and roll band in Italy and continued to pursue an acting career, missing out on the role of Ginger Grant for television’s Gilligan’s Island. Her big break came in 1981 when she was selected to host Fright Night on Los Angeles television, creating the persona of Elvira, Mistress of the Dark with her cleavage revealing black Gothic vampiresque costume, accentuating her breasts. Part of the character was the “Valley Girl” style of talking, giving the character a ditzy, juvenile, but refreshing persona which Cassandra played to perfection. Peterson’s sense of humor and timing reveal her to be a witty and talented comedian. Her character was such a hit, that numerous movie (not always as Elvira) and television appearances followed, along with commercial endorsements and other entertainment based on her Elvira character, including video games, comic books, and pinball games. Her success has even led to a legion of “Elvira” impersonators.6. Sofia Vergara, actress.Born in Columbia in 1972, Sofia came to the United States to pursue a career in modeling and acting after attending 3 years of Dentistry school, only a year shy of graduating. Discovered while on a beach in Columbia, Sofia got work modeling and in commercials as early as age 17, an interest she retained while attending college. Show biz beckoned with richer potential, and the well endowed (32F bust) actress found work hosting Spanish language television shows before hitting the big time and appearing in Hollywood movies. Lately her role in Modern Family on television has been her primary exposure to the public, although she has also worked as a spokesperson for commercial entities such as Cover Girl cosmetics, Pepsi Cola, State Farm Insurance and Kmart stores (among others). An accomplished actress with many nominations and awards, she has her star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Sofia has also done fund raising work for humanitarian reasons, proving she is much more than a pretty face and a killer body (although she has a pretty face and has a killer body!).7. Kate Upton, actress, model.Born in 1992, Kate has plenty of time left to achieve greatness, but at age 25 she already has! A World Champion horse rider a few times over while in her teens, Kate became a model, appearing in the 2011 Swim Suit Issue of Sports Illustrated Magazine. She then appeared on the cover of the Swim Suit Issue in 2012, 2013 and 2017, and has appeared on other magazine covers. Kate has also appeared in major motion pictures, and has measurements of 38-26-37, with a bra size of 34DD.8. Salma Hayek, actress.Only 5’2”, this Mexican-Lebanese-American beauty sports a bra size of 32D with measurements of 36-25-35. Born in Mexico in 1966, it is hard to believe Salma is already 51 years old. The years have been kind to her gorgeous face and hourglass figure, but she is much more than just a sexy actress. Salma attended and graduated from the Universidad Iberoamericana in Mexico City, with a course of study in International Relations. She took her international relations from success in Mexican cinema to Hollywood, where she has continued to star in major motion pictures. She has also worked as a producer and director, using her fine brain and not just relying on good looks. On the other hand, Salma has used those good looks as a spokesperson endorsing cosmetics and toiletries among other things. Hayek has also worked for charitable causes, including the United Nations, and is a naturalized American Citizen. She has worked against violence against women and immigrants, and has also championed women’s rights. Hayek was the Glamour Magazine Woman of the Year in 2011, and has received numerous other awards.9. Alexandra Daddario, actress.With a strikingly classic hourglass figure, with measurements of 38-26-36 and a bra size of 34D, this beauty was destined for a career in front of a camera. Coming from a pedigree of a grandfather that was a US Representative to Congress and a father that headed up the NYPD Counter-Terrorism Unit, Alexandra is no empty head, having attended Marymount Manhattan College after attending prestigious schools as a girl. Alexandra has appeared on television since the age of 16, and has also appeared in numerous motion pictures. Her 2014 role on premium television’s True Detective got her acclaim for her acting. She has also been nominated for several acting awards, though she has not yet won one. At only 31 years old, there is plenty of time for her to take home a prize.10. Shannon Elizabeth and Jennifer Tilly, actresses and Poker Champs.Both of these beautiful, busty actresses show their brainy side while playing poker, with both ladies having won numerous tournaments. Jennifer measures a voluptuous 40-28-38 with a bra size of 34D, while Shannon comes in at 37-25-35 and 34C. Both measure A1 when it comes to being sly with the cards. Tilly has a BA from Stephens College in Missouri, while Elizabeth told the nation she was half Arabic and 100% American after the 9/11 terrorist events, and has done admirable charity work. Tilly is known to wear cleavage revealing low cut tops (with push up bras) while playing poker to disorient men with her ample bosom.Question for students (and subscribers) to ponder: What ladies would you include on today’s list?If you liked this article and would like to receive notification of new articles, please feel welcome to subscribe to History and Headlines by liking us on Facebook and becoming one of our patrons!Your readership is much appreciated!Historical EvidenceFor more information, please see…Crow, Sheryl and Kristi Funk.

Breasts (also called boobs) are fascinating and important parts of the human body, found in both males and females. They play a key role in feeding babies and are influenced by hormones. Breasts also have cultural and symbolic meanings and can be affected by various health conditions. This article explores the anatomy, functions, cultural perspectives, and health considerations of breasts. Key TakeawaysBreasts or boobs are composed of different tissues, including glandular, connective, and fatty tissues, which work together for functions like milk production.Hormones like estrogen and progesterone significantly impact the development and function of breasts, especially during puberty and pregnancy.Breasts hold cultural and symbolic significance, appearing in art, media, and societal attitudes, and they can be affected by various health issues that require awareness and regular screening. Anatomy and Structure of BreastsExternal FeaturesBreasts are located on the chest and are made up of various tissues, including fatty or adipose tissue and glandular tissue, which is a specialized type of tissue that is responsible for the secretion of various substances such as hormones, enzymes, and other important fluids essential for bodily functions. The nipple is at the center of a darker area called the areola. The size and shape of breasts can vary widely among individuals. The areola contains glands that secrete oils to protect the nipple during breastfeeding.Internal CompositionInside the breast, there are 15-20 sections called lobes. Each lobe contains smaller lobules that produce milk. These lobules are connected to milk ducts, which carry milk to the nipple. The breast also contains blood vessels, nerves, and lymph vessels, which help fight infection.Breast Tissue TypesBreasts are made up of two main types of tissue: glandular tissue and fatty tissue. Glandular tissue includes the lobes and lobules that produce milk, while fatty tissue provides shape and size. The ratio of these tissues can vary, affecting the overall appearance of the breast.Functions and Biological SignificanceRole in LactationBreasts play a crucial role in feeding infants. When a baby suckles, the mother's brain releases oxytocin, which causes milk to flow from the alveoli through ducts to the nipple. Breast milk is packed with all the nutrients a baby needs for the first six months of life.Hormonal InfluenceHormones like estrogen, progesterone, and prolactin are key players in breast development and function. Estrogen helps stretch milk ducts, while prolactin and progesterone prepare the glands for milk production. Oxytocin helps in the release of milk.Impact on SexualityBreasts or boobs are often considered an important part of sexual attraction and arousal. They can be sensitive to touch, which can enhance sexual experiences for many people.Cultural Perspectives and SymbolismRepresentation in ArtThroughout history, female breasts have been a significant symbol in art. In ancient cultures, sculptures often depicted women with exaggerated breasts. These figures were seen as symbols of fertility and motherhood.In ancient art, goddesses were sometimes shown nude, but usually in modest poses. This contrasts with male nudity, which was more straightforward. This highlights the complex relationship between societal norms and individual perceptions of the male and female body.Breasts or Boobs in MediaBy examining how breasts are portrayed in various media, we can gain insights into the evolving standards of beauty and their impact on self-esteem.Breasts are often characterized as a sign of beauty and femininity. This is evident in fashion, where push-up bras and low-cut dresses are popular, and can lead to women feeling competitive about their breast size and shape.Cultural AttitudesDifferent cultures have varied views on breasts. In some places, they are seen as purely functional, while in others, they are highly sexualized.For example, in many Western societies, breasts or boobs are often linked to sexuality and attractiveness, and bare breasts are often considered immodest. Whereas in the Himba in Namibia, women go bare-breasted without it being seen as sexual. And in some cultures value larger, drooping breasts as a sign of motherhood and wisdom.Understanding these dynamics is crucial for fostering a more inclusive view of body image. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the role of education in shaping attitudes towards body positivity and acceptance.Health and Medical ConsiderationsCommon ConditionsBreasts can experience a variety of health issues. Some of the most common conditions include:Breast Cancer: A serious condition where cells in the breast grow out of control.Mastitis: An infection often seen in breastfeeding women.Fibrocystic Breasts: Non-cancerous changes that give the breasts a lumpy texture.Gynecomastia: Enlargement of breast tissue in men.Screening and PreventionRegular screening is crucial for early detection of breast issues. Here are some key methods:Mammograms: X-ray images of the breast to detect tumors or abnormalities.Ultrasound: Uses sound waves to create images of breast tissue.MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging for detailed images, often used for high-risk patients.Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.Breast Health and WellnessMaintaining breast health is crucial for overall well-being. Regular check-ups and awareness of changes can lead to early detection of potential issues. Here are some key practices to consider:1. Regular ScreeningsSchedule annual mammograms as recommended by your doctor.Discuss any family history of breast cancer with your doctor to determine appropriate screening intervals.2. Healthy Lifestyle ChoicesEngage in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.Limit alcohol consumption and avoid smoking, as these can increase breast cancer risk.3. Self-ExaminationsPerform monthly self-exams to familiarize yourself with your breast tissue and identify any changes.Here's how you can do a quick breast self-exam at home:Start by looking in the mirror to observe the shape and size of your breasts. Raise your arms above your head and look for any changes in shape or contour. Use the tips of your fingers to feel for any lumps or abnormalities while lying down. Repeat the examination while standing, using a circular motion to cover the entire breast area. Don't forget to check the area under your arms and above your collarbone. If you notice any unusual changes, like unusual lumps, changes in shape, or skin texture, consult your doctor immediately.Remember, being aware of breast health is essential and taking care of your breasts is a vital part of overall health. Always stay informed about breast health through reputable sources.ConclusionBreasts are an important part of the human body, serving both functional and social roles. In females, they are essential for feeding infants, while in both genders, they can be a source of sexual pleasure.Understanding the structure and function of breasts helps us appreciate their complexity and significance. Whether it's the intricate network of ducts and lobules or the cultural meanings attached to them, breasts play a vital role in our lives.By learning more about them, we can better understand our bodies and the ways they contribute to our overall well-being. Frequently Asked QuestionsWhat are the main parts of the breast?The breast has several parts: the nipple, the areola (the darker area around the nipple), lobes, lobules, and ducts. Lobes are divided into smaller lobules, which end in tiny bulbs that produce milk. Ducts are small tubes that carry milk to the nipple.How do breasts change during pregnancy?During pregnancy, hormones like estrogen and progesterone cause the breasts to grow and prepare for milk production. The milk ducts expand, and the lobules increase in number and size, making the breasts larger and sometimes tender.Why are breasts considered erogenous zones?Breasts have many nerve endings, making them sensitive to touch. This sensitivity can make touching or massaging them feel pleasurable, which is why they are considered erogenous zones in many cultures.

Breasts or boobs are often considered an important part of sexual attraction and arousal. They can be sensitive to touch, which can enhance sexual experiences for many people.
Throughout history, female breasts have been a significant symbol in art. In ancient cultures, sculptures often depicted women with exaggerated breasts. These figures were seen as symbols of fertility and motherhood.
In ancient art, goddesses were sometimes shown nude, but usually in modest poses. This contrasts with male nudity, which was more straightforward. This highlights the complex relationship between societal norms and individual perceptions of the male and female body.
By examining how breasts are portrayed in various media, we can gain insights into the evolving standards of beauty and their impact on self-esteem.
Breasts are often characterized as a sign of beauty and femininity. This is evident in fashion, where push-up bras and low-cut dresses are popular, and can lead to women feeling competitive about their breast size and shape.
Different cultures have varied views on breasts. In some places, they are seen as purely functional, while in others, they are highly sexualized.
For example, in many Western societies, breasts or boobs are often linked to sexuality and attractiveness, and bare breasts are often considered immodest. Whereas in the Himba in Namibia, women go bare-breasted without it being seen as sexual. And in some cultures value larger, drooping breasts as a sign of motherhood and wisdom.
Understanding these dynamics is crucial for fostering a more inclusive view of body image. Furthermore, it is essential to recognize the role of education in shaping attitudes towards body positivity and acceptance.
Breasts can experience a variety of health issues. Some of the most common conditions include:
Breast Cancer: A serious condition where cells in the breast grow out of control.
Mastitis: An infection often seen in breastfeeding women.
Fibrocystic Breasts: Non-cancerous changes that give the breasts a lumpy texture.
Gynecomastia: Enlargement of breast tissue in men.
Regular screening is crucial for early detection of breast issues. Here are some key methods:
Mammograms: X-ray images of the breast to detect tumors or abnormalities.
Ultrasound: Uses sound waves to create images of breast tissue.
MRI: Magnetic Resonance Imaging for detailed images, often used for high-risk patients.
Early detection can significantly improve treatment outcomes.
Maintaining breast health is crucial for overall well-being. Regular check-ups and awareness of changes can lead to early detection of potential issues. Here are some key practices to consider:
Schedule annual mammograms as recommended by your doctor.
Discuss any family history of breast cancer with your doctor to determine appropriate screening intervals.
Engage in regular physical activity to maintain a healthy weight.
Follow a balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
Limit alcohol consumption and avoid smoking, as these can increase breast cancer risk.
Perform monthly self-exams to familiarize yourself with your breast tissue and identify any changes.
Here's how you can do a quick breast self-exam at home:Start by looking in the mirror to observe the shape and size of your breasts. Raise your arms above your head and look for any changes in shape or contour. Use the tips of your fingers to feel for any lumps or abnormalities while lying down. Repeat the examination while standing, using a circular motion to cover the entire breast area. Don't forget to check the area under your arms and above your collarbone. If you notice any unusual changes, like unusual lumps, changes in shape, or skin texture, consult your doctor immediately.

Breasts are an important part of the human body, serving both functional and social roles. In females, they are essential for feeding infants, while in both genders, they can be a source of sexual pleasure.
Understanding the structure and function of breasts helps us appreciate their complexity and significance. Whether it's the intricate network of ducts and lobules or the cultural meanings attached to them, breasts play a vital role in our lives.
By learning more about them, we can better understand our bodies and the ways they contribute to our overall well-being.
The breast has several parts: the nipple, the areola (the darker area around the nipple), lobes, lobules, and ducts. Lobes are divided into smaller lobules, which end in tiny bulbs that produce milk. Ducts are small tubes that carry milk to the nipple.
During pregnancy, hormones like estrogen and progesterone cause the breasts to grow and prepare for milk production. The milk ducts expand, and the lobules increase in number and size, making the breasts larger and sometimes tender.
Why are breasts considered erogenous zones?
Breasts have many nerve endings, making them sensitive to touch. This sensitivity can make touching or massaging them feel pleasurable, which is why they are considered erogenous zones in many cultures.

The buttocks (sg.: buttock) are two rounded portions of the exterior anatomy of humans, located on the posterior of the pelvic region. The buttocks are located between the lower back and the perineum. They are composed of a layer of exterior skin and underlying subcutaneous fat superimposed on a left and right gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles. The two gluteus maximus muscles are the largest muscles in the human body. They are responsible for movements such as straightening the body into the upright (standing) posture when it is bent at the waist; maintaining the body in the upright posture by keeping the hip joints extended; and propelling the body forward via further leg (hip) extension when walking or running.[1]
In many cultures, the buttocks play a role in sexual attraction.[2] Many cultures have also used the buttocks as a primary target for corporal punishment,[3] as the buttocks' layer of subcutaneous fat offers protection against injury while still allowing for the infliction of pain.
The buttocks are formed by the masses of the gluteal muscles or "glutes" (the gluteus maximus muscle and the gluteus medius muscle) superimposed by a layer of fat. The superior aspect of the buttock ends at the iliac crest, and the lower aspect is outlined by the horizontal gluteal crease. The gluteus maximus has two insertion points: 1⁄3 superior portion of the linea aspera of the femur, and the superior portion of the iliotibial tractus. The masses of the gluteus maximus muscle are separated by an intermediate intergluteal cleft or "crack" in which the anus is situated.
The analogous anatomical structures known as ischial callosities allow primates to sit upright without resting their weight on their feet as four-legged animals do. The pads enable the monkeys to sleep sitting upright on thin branches, beyond reach of predators, without falling. Humans do not possess ischial callosities due to the gluteal muscles being large enough to provide the same cushioning.[4] Females of certain species of baboon have red callosities that blush to attract males. In the case of humans, females tend to have proportionally wider and thicker buttocks due to higher subcutaneous fat and proportionally wider hips. In humans they also have a role in propelling the body in a forward motion and aiding bowel movement.[5][6]
Some baboons and all gibbons, though otherwise fur-covered, have characteristic naked ischial callosities on their rears. While human children generally have smooth buttocks, mature males and females have varying degrees of hair growth, as on other parts of their body. Females may have hair growth in the gluteal cleft (including around the anus), sometimes extending laterally onto the lower aspect of the cheeks. Males may have hair growth over some or all of the buttocks.
The Latin name for the buttocks is nates (English pronunciation /ˈneɪtiːz/ NAY-teez,[7] classical pronunciation nătes [ˈnateːs][8]) which is plural; the singular, natis (buttock), is rarely used. There are many colloquial terms for them.

Race is a categorization of humans based on shared physical or social qualities into groups generally viewed as distinct within a given society.[1] The term came into common usage during the 16th century, when it was used to refer to groups of various kinds, including those characterized by close kinship relations.[2] By the 17th century, the term began to refer to physical (phenotypical) traits, and then later to national affiliations. Modern science regards race as a social construct, an identity which is assigned based on rules made by society.[3][4][5] While partly based on physical similarities within groups, race does not have an inherent physical or biological meaning.[1][6][7] The concept of race is foundational to racism, the belief that humans can be divided based on the superiority of one race over another.
Social conceptions and groupings of races have varied over time, often involving folk taxonomies that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits.[8] Modern scientists consider such biological essentialism obsolete,[9] and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.[10][11][12][13][14]
Even though there is a broad scientific agreement that essentialist and typological conceptions of race are untenable,[15][16][17][18][19][20] scientists around the world continue to conceptualize race in widely differing ways.[21] While some researchers continue to use the concept of race to make distinctions among fuzzy sets of traits or observable differences in behavior, others in the scientific community suggest that the idea of race is inherently naive[10] or simplistic.[22] Still others argue that, among humans, race has no taxonomic significance because all living humans belong to the same subspecies, Homo sapiens sapiens.[23][24]
Since the second half of the 20th century, race has been associated with discredited theories of scientific racism and has become increasingly seen as an essentially pseudoscientific system of classification. Although still used in general contexts, race has often been replaced by less ambiguous and/or loaded terms: populations, people(s), ethnic groups, or communities, depending on context.[25][26] Its use in genetics was formally renounced by the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in 2023.[27]
Modern scholarship views racial categories as socially constructed, that is, race is not intrinsic to human beings but rather an identity created, often by socially dominant groups, to establish meaning in a social context. Different cultures define different racial groups, often focused on the largest groups of social relevance, and these definitions can change over time.
Historical race concepts have included a wide variety of schemes to divide local or worldwide populations into races and sub-races. Across the world, different organizations and societies choose to disambiguate race to different extents:
In South Africa, the Population Registration Act, 1950 recognized only White, Black, and Coloured, with Indians added later.[28]
The government of Myanmar recognizes eight "major national ethnic races".
The Brazilian census classifies people into brancos (Whites), pardos (multiracial), pretos (Blacks), amarelos (Asians), and indigenous (see Race and ethnicity in Brazil), though many people use different terms to identify themselves.
Legal definitions of whiteness in the United States used before the civil rights movement were often challenged for specific groups. Furthermore, the United States Census Bureau proposed but then withdrew plans to add a new category to classify Middle Eastern and North African peoples in the 2020 U.S. census, due to a dispute over whether this classification should be considered a white ethnicity or a separate race.[29]

The establishment of racial boundaries often involves the subjugation of groups defined as racially inferior, as in the one-drop rule used in the 19th-century United States to exclude those with any amount of African ancestry from the dominant racial grouping, defined as "white".[1] Such racial identities reflect the cultural attitudes of imperial powers dominant during the age of European colonial expansion.[6] This view rejects the notion that race is biologically defined.[30][31][32][33]
According to geneticist David Reich, "while race may be a social construct, differences in genetic ancestry that happen to correlate to many of today's racial constructs are real".[34] In response to Reich, a group of 67 scientists from a broad range of disciplines wrote that his concept of race was "flawed" as "the meaning and significance of the groups is produced through social interventions".[35]
Although commonalities in physical traits such as facial features, skin color, and hair texture comprise part of the race concept, this linkage is a social distinction rather than an inherently biological one.[1] Other dimensions of racial groupings include shared history, traditions, and language. For instance, African-American English is a dialect of English spoken by many African Americans, especially in areas of the United States where racial segregation formerly existed. Furthermore, many people often will self-identify as members of a race for political reasons.[1]
When people define and talk about a particular conception of race, they create a social reality through which social categorization is achieved.[36] In this sense, races are said to be social constructs.[37] These constructs develop within various legal, economic, and sociopolitical contexts, and may be the effect, rather than the cause, of major social situations.[clarify][38] While race is understood to be a social construct by many, most scholars agree that race has real material effects in the lives of people through institutionalized practices of preference and discrimination.[39]
Socioeconomic factors, in combination with early but enduring views of race, have led to considerable suffering within disadvantaged racial groups.[40] Racial discrimination often coincides with racist mindsets, whereby the individuals and ideologies of one group come to perceive the members of an outgroup as both racially defined and morally inferior.[41] As a result, racial groups possessing relatively little power often find themselves excluded or oppressed, while hegemonic individuals and institutions are charged with holding racist attitudes.[42] Racism has led to many instances of tragedy, including slavery and genocide.[43]
In some countries, law enforcement uses race to profile suspects. This use of racial categories is frequently criticized for perpetuating an outmoded understanding of human biological variation, and promoting stereotypes. Because in some societies racial groupings correspond closely with patterns of social stratification, for social scientists studying social inequality, race can be a significant variable. As sociological factors, racial categories may in part reflect subjective attributions, self-identities, and social institutions.[44][45]
Scholars continue to debate the degrees to which racial categories are biologically warranted and socially constructed.[46] For example, in 2008, John Hartigan Jr. argued for a view of race that focused primarily on culture, but which does not ignore the potential relevance of biology or genetics.[47] Accordingly, the racial paradigms employed in different disciplines vary in their emphasis on biological reduction as contrasted with societal construction.
In the social sciences, theoretical frameworks such as racial formation theory and critical race theory investigate implications of race as social construction by exploring how the images, ideas and assumptions of race are expressed in everyday life. A large body of scholarship has traced the relationships between the historical and social production of race in legal and criminal language, and their effects on the policing and disproportionate incarceration of certain groups.

Groups of humans have always identified themselves as distinct from neighboring groups, but such differences have not always been understood to be natural, immutable and global. These features are the distinguishing features of how the concept of race is used today. In this way the idea of race as we understand it today came about during the historical process of exploration and conquest which brought Europeans into contact with groups from different continents, and of the ideology of classification and typology found in the natural sciences.[48] The term race was often used in a general biological taxonomic sense,[25] starting from the 19th century, to denote genetically differentiated human populations defined by phenotype.[49][50]
The modern concept of race emerged as a product of the colonial enterprises of European powers from the 16th to 18th centuries which identified race in terms of skin color and physical differences. Author Rebecca F. Kennedy argues that the Greeks and Romans would have found such concepts confusing in relation to their own systems of classification.[51] According to Bancel et al., the epistemological moment where the modern concept of race was invented and rationalized lies somewhere between 1730 and 1790.[52]
According to Smedley and Marks the European concept of "race", along with many of the ideas now associated with the term, arose at the time of the Scientific Revolution, which introduced and privileged the study of natural kinds, and the age of European imperialism and colonization which established political relations between Europeans and peoples with distinct cultural and political traditions.[48][53] As Europeans encountered people from different parts of the world, they speculated about the physical, social, and cultural differences among various human groups. The rise of the Atlantic slave trade, which gradually displaced an earlier trade in slaves from throughout the world, created a further incentive to categorize human groups in order to justify the subordination of African slaves.[54]
Drawing on sources from classical antiquity and upon their own internal interactions – for example, the hostility between the English and Irish powerfully influenced early European thinking about the differences between people[55] – Europeans began to sort themselves and others into groups based on physical appearance, and to attribute to individuals belonging to these groups behaviors and capacities which were claimed to be deeply ingrained. A set of folk beliefs took hold that linked inherited physical differences between groups to inherited intellectual, behavioral, and moral qualities.[56] Similar ideas can be found in other cultures,[57] for example in China, where a concept often translated as "race" was associated with supposed common descent from the Yellow Emperor, and used to stress the unity of ethnic groups in China. Brutal conflicts between ethnic groups have existed throughout history and across the world.[58]
The first post-Graeco-Roman published classification of humans into distinct races seems to be François Bernier's Nouvelle division de la terre par les différents espèces ou races qui l'habitent ("New division of Earth by the different species or races which inhabit it"), published in 1684.[59] In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human species Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively.[60][61] Homo sapiens europaeus was described as active, acute, and adventurous, whereas Homo sapiens afer was said to be crafty, lazy, and careless.[62]
The 1775 treatise "The Natural Varieties of Mankind", by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach proposed five major divisions: the Caucasoid race, the Mongoloid race, the Ethiopian race (later termed Negroid), the American Indian race, and the Malayan race, but he did not propose any hierarchy among the races.[62] Blumenbach also noted the graded transition in appearances from one group to adjacent groups and suggested that "one variety of mankind does so sensibly pass into the other, that you cannot mark out the limits between them".[63]
From the 17th through 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what Smedley has called an "ideology of race".[53] According to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct. It was further argued that some groups may be the result of mixture between formerly distinct populations, but that careful study could distinguish the ancestral races that had combined to produce admixed groups.[58] Subsequent influential classifications by Georges Buffon, Petrus Camper and Christoph Meiners all classified "Negros" as inferior to Europeans.[62] In the United States the racial theories of Thomas Jefferson were influential. He saw Africans as inferior to Whites especially in regards to their intellect, and imbued with unnatural sexual appetites, but described Native Americans as equals to whites.[64]
In the last two decades of the 18th century, the theory of polygenism, the belief that different races had evolved separately in each continent and shared no common ancestor,[65] was advocated in England by historian Edward Long and anatomist Charles White, in Germany by ethnographers Christoph Meiners and Georg Forster, and in France by Julien-Joseph Virey. In the US, Samuel George Morton, Josiah Nott and Louis Agassiz promoted this theory in the mid-19th century. Polygenism was popular and most widespread in the 19th century, culminating in the founding of the Anthropological Society of London (1863), which, during the period of the American Civil War, broke away from the Ethnological Society of London and its monogenic stance, their underlined difference lying, relevantly, in the so-called "Negro question": a substantial racist view by the former,[66] and a more liberal view on race by the latter.[67]
Today, all humans are classified as belonging to the species Homo sapiens. However, this is not the first species of homininae: the first species of the genus Homo, Homo habilis, evolved in East Africa at least 2 million years ago, and members of this species populated different parts of Africa in a relatively short time. Homo erectus evolved more than 1.8 million years ago and, by 1.5 million years ago, had spread throughout Europe and Asia. Virtually all physical anthropologists agree that Archaic Homo sapiens (A group including the possible species H. heidelbergensis, H. rhodesiensis, and H. neanderthalensis) evolved out of African H. erectus (sensu lato) or H. ergaster.[68][69] Anthropologists support the idea that anatomically modern humans (Homo sapiens) evolved in North or East Africa from an archaic human species such as H. heidelbergensis and then migrated out of Africa, mixing with and replacing H. heidelbergensis and H. neanderthalensis populations throughout Europe and Asia, and H. rhodesiensis populations in Sub-Saharan Africa (a combination of the Out of Africa and Multiregional models).[70][verification needed]
In the early 20th century, many anthropologists taught that race was an entirely biological phenomenon and that this was core to a person's behavior and identity, a position commonly called racial essentialism.[71] This, coupled with the belief that linguistic, cultural, and social groups fundamentally existed along racial lines, formed the basis of what is now called scientific racism.[72] After the Nazi eugenics program, along with the rise of anti-colonial movements, racial essentialism lost widespread popularity.[73] New studies of culture and the fledgling field of population genetics undermined the scientific standing of racial essentialism, leading race anthropologists to revise their conclusions about the sources of phenotypic variation.[71] A significant number of modern anthropologists and biologists in the West came to view race as an invalid genetic or biological designation.[74]
The first to challenge the concept of race on empirical grounds were the anthropologists Franz Boas, who provided evidence of phenotypic plasticity due to environmental factors,[75] and Ashley Montagu, who relied on evidence from genetics.[76] E. O. Wilson then challenged the concept from the perspective of general animal systematics and further rejected the claim that "races" were equivalent to "subspecies".[77]
Human genetic variation is predominantly within races, continuous, and complex in structure, which is inconsistent with the concept of genetic human races.[78] According to the biological anthropologist Jonathan Marks,[48]
By the 1970s, it had become clear that (1) most human differences were cultural; (2) what was not cultural was principally polymorphic – that is to say, found in diverse groups of people at different frequencies; (3) what was not cultural or polymorphic was principally clinal – that is to say, gradually variable over geography; and (4) what was left – the component of human diversity that was not cultural, polymorphic, or clinal – was very small.
A consensus consequently developed among anthropologists and geneticists that race as the previous generation had known it – as largely discrete, geographically distinct, gene pools – did not exist.
The term race in biology is used with caution because it can be ambiguous. Generally, when it is used it is effectively a synonym of subspecies.[79] (For animals, the only taxonomic unit below the species level is usually the subspecies;[80] there are narrower infraspecific ranks in botany, and race does not correspond directly with any of them.) Traditionally, subspecies are seen as geographically isolated and genetically differentiated populations.[81] Studies of human genetic variation show that human populations are not geographically isolated,[82] and their genetic differences are far smaller than those among comparable subspecies.[83]
In 1978, Sewall Wright suggested that human populations that have long inhabited separated parts of the world should generally be considered different subspecies by the criterion that most individuals of such populations can be allocated correctly by inspection. Wright argued: "It does not require a trained anthropologist to classify an array of Englishmen, West Africans, and Chinese with 100% accuracy by features, skin color, and type of hair despite so much variability within each of these groups that every individual can easily be distinguished from every other."[84] In practice, subspecies are commonly identified based on easily observable physical traits, but the variations in these traits among members of a species do not always hold evolutionary significance, resulting in a decreased acceptance of this classification method among evolutionary biologists.[85] Likewise, this typological approach to race is generally regarded as discredited by biologists and anthropologists.[86][17]
Ancestrally differentiated populations (clades)
In 2000, philosopher Robin Andreasen proposed that cladistics might be used to categorize human races biologically and that races can be both biologically real and socially constructed.[87] Andreasen cited tree diagrams of relative genetic distances among populations published by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza as the basis for a phylogenetic tree of human races (p. 661). Biological anthropologist Jonathan Marks (2008) responded by arguing that Andreasen had misinterpreted the genetic literature: "These trees are phenetic (based on similarity), rather than cladistic (based on monophyletic descent, that is from a series of unique ancestors)."[88] Evolutionary biologist Alan Templeton (2013) argued that multiple lines of evidence falsify the idea of a phylogenetic tree structure to human genetic diversity and confirm the presence of gene flow among populations.[33] Marks, Templeton, and Cavalli-Sforza all conclude that genetics does not provide evidence of human races.[33][89]
Previously, anthropologists Lieberman and Jackson (1995) had also critiqued the use of cladistics to support concepts of race. They argued that "the molecular and biochemical proponents of this model explicitly use racial categories in their initial grouping of samples". For example, the large and highly diverse macroethnic groups of East Indians, North Africans, and Europeans are presumptively grouped as Caucasians prior to the analysis of their DNA variation. They argued that this a priori grouping limits and skews interpretations, obscures other lineage relationships, deemphasizes the impact of more immediate clinal environmental factors on genomic diversity, and can cloud our understanding of the true patterns of affinity.[90]
In 2015, Keith Hunley, Graciela Cabana, and Jeffrey Long analyzed the Human Genome Diversity Project sample of 1,037 individuals in 52 populations,[91] finding that diversity among non-African populations is the result of a serial founder effect process, with non-African populations as a whole nested among African populations, that "some African populations are equally related to other African populations and to non-African populations", and that "outside of Africa, regional groupings of populations are nested inside one another, and many of them are not monophyletic".[91] Earlier research had also suggested that there has always been considerable gene flow between human populations, meaning that human population groups are not monophyletic.[81] Rachel Caspari has argued that since no groups currently regarded as races are monophyletic, by definition, none of these groups can be clades.[92]
One crucial innovation in reconceptualizing genotypic and phenotypic variation was the anthropologist C. Loring Brace's observation that such variations, insofar as they are affected by natural selection, slow migration, or genetic drift, are distributed along geographic gradations or clines.[93] For example, with respect to skin color in Europe and Africa, Brace writes:[94]
To this day, skin color grades by imperceptible means from Europe southward around the eastern end of the Mediterranean and up the Nile into Africa. From one end of this range to the other, there is no hint of a skin color boundary, and yet the spectrum runs from the lightest in the world at the northern edge to as dark as it is possible for humans to be at the equator.
This is partly due to isolation by distance, a point that called attention to a problem common to phenotype-based descriptions of races (e.g., those based on hair texture and skin color): they ignore a host of other similarities and differences (for example, blood type) that do not correlate highly with the markers for race. Thus, anthropologist Frank Livingstone concluded that, since clines cross racial boundaries, "there are no races, only clines."[95]
In a response to Livingstone, Theodore Dobzhansky argued that when talking about race, one must be attentive to how the term is being used: "I agree with Dr. Livingstone that if races have to be 'discrete units', then there are no races, and if 'race' is used as an 'explanation' of the human variability, rather than vice versa, then the explanation is invalid." He further argued that one could use the term race if one distinguished between "race differences" and "the race concept". The former refers to any distinction in gene frequencies between populations; the latter is "a matter of judgment". He further observed that even when there is clinal variation: "Race differences are objectively ascertainable biological phenomena ... but it does not follow that racially distinct populations must be given racial (or subspecific) labels."[95] In short, Livingstone and Dobzhansky agree that there are genetic differences among human beings; they also agree that the use of the race concept to classify people, and how the race concept is used, is a matter of social convention. They differ on whether the race concept remains a meaningful and useful social convention.
In 1964, the biologists Paul Ehrlich and Holm pointed out cases where two or more clines are distributed discordantly – for example, melanin is distributed in a decreasing pattern from the equator north and south; frequencies for the haplotype for beta-S hemoglobin, on the other hand, radiate out of specific geographical points in Africa.[96] As the anthropologists Leonard Lieberman and Fatimah Linda Jackson observed, "Discordant patterns of heterogeneity falsify any description of a population as if it were genotypically or even phenotypically homogeneous".[90]
Patterns such as those seen in human physical and genetic variation as described above, have led to the consequence that the number and geographic location of any described races is highly dependent on the importance attributed to, and quantity of, the traits considered. A skin-lightening mutation, estimated to have occurred 20,000 to 50,000 years ago, partially accounts for the appearance of light skin in people who migrated out of Africa northward into what is now Europe. East Asians owe their relatively light skin to different mutations.[97] On the other hand, the greater the number of traits (or alleles) considered, the more subdivisions of humanity are detected, since traits and gene frequencies do not always correspond to the same geographical location. Or as Ossorio & Duster (2005) put it:
Anthropologists long ago discovered that humans' physical traits vary gradually, with groups that are close geographic neighbors being more similar than groups that are geographically separated. This pattern of variation, known as clinal variation, is also observed for many alleles that vary from one human group to another. Another observation is that traits or alleles that vary from one group to another do not vary at the same rate. This pattern is referred to as nonconcordant variation. Because the variation of physical traits is clinal and nonconcordant, anthropologists of the late 19th and early 20th centuries discovered that the more traits and the more human groups they measured, the fewer discrete differences they observed among races and the more categories they had to create to classify human beings. The number of races observed expanded to the 1930s and 1950s, and eventually anthropologists concluded that there were no discrete races.[98] Twentieth and 21st century biomedical researchers have discovered this same feature when evaluating human variation at the level of alleles and allele frequencies. Nature has not created four or five distinct, nonoverlapping genetic groups of people.
Another way to look at differences between populations is to measure genetic differences rather than physical differences between groups. The mid-20th-century anthropologist William C. Boyd defined race as: "A population which differs significantly from other populations in regard to the frequency of one or more of the genes it possesses. It is an arbitrary matter which, and how many, gene loci we choose to consider as a significant 'constellation'".[99] Leonard Lieberman and Rodney Kirk have pointed out that "the paramount weakness of this statement is that if one gene can distinguish races then the number of races is as numerous as the number of human couples reproducing".[100] Moreover, the anthropologist Stephen Molnar has suggested that the discordance of clines inevitably results in a multiplication of races that renders the concept itself useless.[101] The Human Genome Project states "People who have lived in the same geographic region for many generations may have some alleles in common, but no allele will be found in all members of one population and in no members of any other."[102] Massimo Pigliucci and Jonathan Kaplan argue that human races do exist, and that they correspond to the genetic classification of ecotypes, but that real human races do not correspond very much, if at all, to folk racial categories.[103] In contrast, Walsh & Yun reviewed the literature in 2011 and reported: "Genetic studies using very few chromosomal loci find that genetic polymorphisms divide human populations into clusters with almost 100 percent accuracy and that they correspond to the traditional anthropological categories."[104]
Some biologists argue that racial categories correlate with biological traits (e.g. phenotype), and that certain genetic markers have varying frequencies among human populations, some of which correspond more or less to traditional racial groupings.[105]
The distribution of genetic variants within and among human populations are impossible to describe succinctly because of the difficulty of defining a population, the clinal nature of variation, and heterogeneity across the genome (Long and Kittles 2003). In general, however, an average of 85% of statistical genetic variation exists within local populations, ≈7% is between local populations within the same continent, and ≈8% of variation occurs between large groups living on different continents.[106][107] The recent African origin theory for humans would predict that in Africa there exists a great deal more diversity than elsewhere and that diversity should decrease the further from Africa a population is sampled. Hence, the 85% average figure is misleading: Long and Kittles find that rather than 85% of human genetic diversity existing in all human populations, about 100% of human diversity exists in a single African population, whereas only about 60% of human genetic diversity exists in the least diverse population they analyzed (the Surui, a population derived from New Guinea).[108] Statistical analysis that takes this difference into account confirms previous findings that "Western-based racial classifications have no taxonomic significance".[91]
A 2002 study of random biallelic genetic loci found little to no evidence that humans were divided into distinct biological groups.[109]
In his 2003 paper, "Human Genetic Diversity: Lewontin's Fallacy", A. W. F. Edwards argued that rather than using a locus-by-locus analysis of variation to derive taxonomy, it is possible to construct a human classification system based on characteristic genetic patterns, or clusters inferred from multilocus genetic data.[110][111] Geographically based human studies since have shown that such genetic clusters can be derived from analyzing of a large number of loci which can assort individuals sampled into groups analogous to traditional continental racial groups.[112][113] Joanna Mountain and Neil Risch cautioned that while genetic clusters may one day be shown to correspond to phenotypic variations between groups, such assumptions were premature as the relationship between genes and complex traits remains poorly understood.[114] However, Risch denied such limitations render the analysis useless: "Perhaps just using someone's actual birth year is not a very good way of measuring age. Does that mean we should throw it out? ... Any category you come up with is going to be imperfect, but that doesn't preclude you from using it or the fact that it has utility."[115]
Early human genetic cluster analysis studies were conducted with samples taken from ancestral population groups living at extreme geographic distances from each other. It was thought that such large geographic distances would maximize the genetic variation between the groups sampled in the analysis, and thus maximize the probability of finding cluster patterns unique to each group. In light of the historically recent acceleration of human migration (and correspondingly, human gene flow) on a global scale, further studies were conducted to judge the degree to which genetic cluster analysis can pattern ancestrally identified groups as well as geographically separated groups. One such study looked at a large multiethnic population in the United States, and "detected only modest genetic differentiation between different current geographic locales within each race/ethnicity group. Thus, ancient geographic ancestry, which is highly correlated with self-identified race/ethnicity – as opposed to current residence – is the major determinant of genetic structure in the U.S. population."[113]
Witherspoon et al. (2007) have argued that even when individuals can be reliably assigned to specific population groups, it may still be possible for two randomly chosen individuals from different populations/clusters to be more similar to each other than to a randomly chosen member of their own cluster. They found that many thousands of genetic markers had to be used in order for the answer to the question "How often is a pair of individuals from one population genetically more dissimilar than two individuals chosen from two different populations?" to be "never". This assumed three population groups separated by large geographic ranges (European, African and East Asian). The entire world population is much more complex and studying an increasing number of groups would require an increasing number of markers for the same answer. The authors conclude that "caution should be used when using geographic or genetic ancestry to make inferences about individual phenotypes".[116] Witherspoon, et al. concluded: "The fact that, given enough genetic data, individuals can be correctly assigned to their populations of origin is compatible with the observation that most human genetic variation is found within populations, not between them. It is also compatible with our finding that, even when the most distinct populations are considered and hundreds of loci are used, individuals are frequently more similar to members of other populations than to members of their own population."[116]
Anthropologists such as C. Loring Brace,[117] the philosophers Jonathan Kaplan and Rasmus Winther,[118][119][120][121] and the geneticist Joseph Graves,[122] have argued that the cluster structure of genetic data is dependent on the initial hypotheses of the researcher and the influence of these hypotheses on the choice of populations to sample. When one samples continental groups, the clusters become continental, but if one had chosen other sampling patterns, the clustering would be different. Weiss and Fullerton have noted that if one sampled only Icelanders, Mayans and Maoris, three distinct clusters would form and all other populations could be described as being clinally composed of admixtures of Maori, Icelandic and Mayan genetic materials.[123] Kaplan and Winther therefore argue that, seen in this way, both Lewontin and Edwards are right in their arguments. They conclude that while racial groups are characterized by different allele frequencies, this does not mean that racial classification is a natural taxonomy of the human species, because multiple other genetic patterns can be found in human populations that crosscut racial distinctions. Moreover, the genomic data underdetermines whether one wishes to see subdivisions (i.e., splitters) or a continuum (i.e., lumpers). Under Kaplan and Winther's view, racial groupings are objective social constructions (see Mills 1998[124]) that have conventional biological reality only insofar as the categories are chosen and constructed for pragmatic scientific reasons. In earlier work, Winther had identified "diversity partitioning" and "clustering analysis" as two separate methodologies, with distinct questions, assumptions, and protocols. Each is also associated with opposing ontological consequences vis-a-vis the metaphysics of race.[120] Philosopher Lisa Gannett has argued that biogeographical ancestry, a concept devised by Mark Shriver and Tony Frudakis, is not an objective measure of the biological aspects of race as Shriver and Frudakis claim it is. She argues that it is actually just a "local category shaped by the U.S. context of its production, especially the forensic aim of being able to predict the race or ethnicity of an unknown suspect based on DNA found at the crime scene".[125]
Recent studies of human genetic clustering have included a debate over how genetic variation is organized, with clusters and clines as the main possible orderings. Serre & Pääbo (2004) argued for smooth, clinal genetic variation in ancestral populations even in regions previously considered racially homogeneous, with the apparent gaps turning out to be artifacts of sampling techniques. Rosenberg et al. (2005) disputed this and offered an analysis of the Human Genetic Diversity Panel showing that there were small discontinuities in the smooth genetic variation for ancestral populations at the location of geographic barriers such as the Sahara, the Oceans, and the Himalayas. Nonetheless, Rosenberg et al. (2005) stated that their findings "should not be taken as evidence of our support of any particular concept of biological race ... Genetic differences among human populations derive mainly from gradations in allele frequencies rather than from distinctive 'diagnostic' genotypes." Using a sample of 40 populations distributed roughly evenly across the Earth's land surface, Xing & et al. (2010, p. 208) found that "genetic diversity is distributed in a more clinal pattern when more geographically intermediate populations are sampled".
Guido Barbujani has written that human genetic variation is generally distributed continuously in gradients across much of Earth, and that there is no evidence that genetic boundaries between human populations exist as would be necessary for human races to exist.[126]
Over time, human genetic variation has formed a nested structure that is inconsistent with the concept of races that have evolved independently of one another.[127]
As anthropologists and other evolutionary scientists have shifted away from the language of race to the term population to talk about genetic differences, historians, cultural anthropologists and other social scientists re-conceptualized the term "race" as a cultural category or identity, i.e., a way among many possible ways in which a society chooses to divide its members into categories.
Many social scientists have replaced the word race with the word "ethnicity" to refer to self-identifying groups based on beliefs concerning shared culture, ancestry and history. Alongside empirical and conceptual problems with "race", following the Second World War, evolutionary and social scientists were acutely aware of how beliefs about race had been used to justify discrimination, apartheid, slavery, and genocide. This questioning gained momentum in the 1960s during the civil rights movement in the United States and the emergence of numerous anti-colonial movements worldwide. They thus came to believe that race itself is a social construct, a concept that was believed to correspond to an objective reality but which was believed in because of its social functions.[128]
Craig Venter and Francis Collins of the National Institute of Health jointly made the announcement of the mapping of the human genome in 2000. Upon examining the data from the genome mapping, Venter realized that although the genetic variation within the human species is on the order of 1–3% (instead of the previously assumed 1%), the types of variations do not support the notion of genetically defined races. Venter said, "Race is a social concept. It's not a scientific one. There are no bright lines (that would stand out), if we could compare all the sequenced genomes of everyone on the planet. ... When we try to apply science to try to sort out these social differences, it all falls apart."[129]
Anthropologist Stephan Palmié has argued that race "is not a thing but a social relation";[130] or, in the words of Katya Gibel Mevorach, "a metonym", "a human invention whose criteria for differentiation are neither universal nor fixed but have always been used to manage difference".[131] As such, the use of the term "race" itself must be analyzed. Moreover, they argue that biology will not explain why or how people use the idea of race; only history and social relationships will.
Imani Perry has argued that race "is produced by social arrangements and political decision making",[132] and that "race is something that happens, rather than something that is. It is dynamic, but it holds no objective truth."[133] Similarly, in Racial Culture: A Critique (2005), Richard T. Ford argued that while "there is no necessary correspondence between the ascribed identity of race and one's culture or personal sense of self" and "group difference is not intrinsic to members of social groups but rather contingent o[n] the social practices of group identification", the social practices of identity politics may coerce individuals into the "compulsory" enactment of "prewritten racial scripts".[134]
Compared to 19th-century United States, 20th-century Brazil was characterized by a perceived relative absence of sharply defined racial groups. According to anthropologist Marvin Harris, this pattern reflects a different history and different social relations.
Race in Brazil was "biologized", but in a way that recognized the difference between ancestry (which determines genotype) and phenotypic differences. There, racial identity was not governed by rigid descent rule, such as the one-drop rule, as it was in the United States. A Brazilian child was never automatically identified with the racial type of one or both parents, nor were there only a very limited number of categories to choose from,[135] to the extent that full siblings can pertain to different racial groups.[136]
Over a dozen racial categories would be recognized in conformity with all the possible combinations of hair color, hair texture, eye color, and skin color. These types grade into each other like the colors of the spectrum, and not one category stands significantly isolated from the rest. That is, race referred preferentially to appearance, not heredity, and appearance is a poor indication of ancestry, because only a few genes are responsible for someone's skin color and traits: a person who is considered white may have more African ancestry than a person who is considered black, and the reverse can be also true about European ancestry.[138] The complexity of racial classifications in Brazil reflects the extent of genetic mixing in Brazilian society, a society that remains highly, but not strictly, stratified along color lines. These socioeconomic factors are also significant to the limits of racial lines, because a minority of pardos, or brown people, are likely to start declaring themselves white or black if socially upward,[139] and being seen as relatively "whiter" as their perceived social status increases (much as in other regions of Latin America).[140]
Fluidity of racial categories aside, the "biologification" of race in Brazil referred above would match contemporary concepts of race in the United States quite closely, though, if Brazilians are supposed to choose their race as one among, Asian and Indigenous apart, three IBGE's census categories. While assimilated Amerindians and people with very high quantities of Amerindian ancestry are usually grouped as caboclos, a subgroup of pardos which roughly translates as both mestizo and hillbilly, for those of lower quantity of Amerindian descent a higher European genetic contribution is expected to be grouped as a pardo. In several genetic tests, people with less than 60–65% of European descent and 5–10% of Amerindian descent usually cluster with Afro-Brazilians (as reported by the individuals), or 6.9% of the population, and those with about 45% or more of Subsaharan contribution most times do so (in average, Afro-Brazilian DNA was reported to be about 50% Subsaharan African, 37% European and 13% Amerindian).[141][142][143][144]
If a more consistent report with the genetic groups in the gradation of genetic mixing is to be considered (e.g. that would not cluster people with a balanced degree of African and non-African ancestry in the black group instead of the multiracial one, unlike elsewhere in Latin America where people of high quantity of African descent tend to classify themselves as mixed), more people would report themselves as white and pardo in Brazil (47.7% and 42.4% of the population as of 2010, respectively), because by research its population is believed to have between 65 and 80% of autosomal European ancestry, in average (also >35% of European mt-DNA and >95% of European Y-DNA).[141][147][148][149]
From the last decades of the Empire until the 1950s, the proportion of the white population increased significantly while Brazil welcomed 5.5 million immigrants between 1821 and 1932, not much behind its neighbor Argentina with 6.4 million,[150] and it received more European immigrants in its colonial history than the United States. Between 1500 and 1760, 700.000 Europeans settled in Brazil, while 530.000 Europeans settled in the United States for the same given time.[151] Thus, the historical construction of race in Brazilian society dealt primarily with gradations between persons of majority European ancestry and little minority groups with otherwise lower quantity therefrom in recent times.
According to the Council of the European Union:
The European Union rejects theories which attempt to determine the existence of separate human races.
The European Union uses the terms racial origin and ethnic origin synonymously in its documents and according to it "the use of the term 'racial origin' in this directive does not imply an acceptance of such [racial] theories".[152][153][full citation needed] Haney López warns that using "race" as a category within the law tends to legitimize its existence in the popular imagination. In the diverse geographic context of Europe, ethnicity and ethnic origin are arguably more resonant and are less encumbered by the ideological baggage associated with "race". In European context, historical resonance of "race" underscores its problematic nature. In some states, it is strongly associated with laws promulgated by the Nazi and Fascist governments in Europe during the 1930s and 1940s. Indeed, in 1996, the European Parliament adopted a resolution stating that "the term should therefore be avoided in all official texts".[154]
The concept of racial origin relies on the notion that human beings can be separated into biologically distinct "races", an idea generally rejected by the scientific community. Since all human beings belong to the same species, the ECRI (European Commission against Racism and Intolerance) rejects theories based on the existence of different "races". However, in its Recommendation ECRI uses this term in order to ensure that those persons who are generally and erroneously perceived as belonging to "another race" are not excluded from the protection provided for by the legislation. The law claims to reject the existence of "race", yet penalize situations where someone is treated less favourably on this ground.[154]
The immigrants to the United States came from every region of Europe, Africa, and Asia. They mixed among themselves and with the indigenous inhabitants of the continent. In the United States most people who self-identify as African American have some European ancestors, while many people who identify as European American have some African or Amerindian ancestors.[citation needed]
Since the early history of the United States, Amerindians, African Americans, and European Americans have been classified as belonging to different races. Efforts to track mixing between groups led to a proliferation of categories, such as mulatto and octoroon. The criteria for membership in these races diverged in the late 19th century. During the Reconstruction era, increasing numbers of Americans began to consider anyone with "one drop" of known "Black blood" to be Black, regardless of appearance. By the early 20th century, this notion was made statutory in many states. Amerindians continue to be defined by a certain percentage of "Indian blood" (called blood quantum). To be White one had to have perceived "pure" White ancestry. The one-drop rule or hypodescent rule refers to the convention of defining a person as racially black if he or she has any known African ancestry. This rule meant that those that were mixed race but with some discernible African ancestry were defined as black. The one-drop rule is specific to not only those with African ancestry but to the United States, making it a particularly African-American experience.[155]
The decennial censuses conducted since 1790 in the United States created an incentive to establish racial categories and fit people into these categories.[156]
The term "Hispanic" as an ethnonym emerged in the 20th century with the rise of migration of laborers from the Spanish-speaking countries of Latin America to the United States. Today, the word "Latino" is often used as a synonym for "Hispanic". The definitions of both terms are non-race specific, and include people who consider themselves to be of distinct races (Black, White, Amerindian, Asian, and mixed groups).[157] However, there is a common misconception in the US that Hispanic/Latino is a race[158] or sometimes even that national origins such as Mexican, Cuban, Colombian, Salvadoran, etc. are races. In contrast to "Latino" or "Hispanic", "Anglo" refers to non-Hispanic White Americans or non-Hispanic European Americans, most of whom speak the English language but are not necessarily of English descent.
The concept of race classification in physical anthropology lost credibility around the 1960s and is now considered untenable.[159][160][161] A 2019 statement by the American Association of Physical Anthropologists declares:
Race does not provide an accurate representation of human biological variation. It was never accurate in the past, and it remains inaccurate when referencing contemporary human populations. Humans are not divided biologically into distinct continental types or racial genetic clusters. Instead, the Western concept of race must be understood as a classification system that emerged from, and in support of, European colonialism, oppression, and discrimination.[86]
Wagner et al. (2017) surveyed 3,286 American anthropologists' views on race and genetics, including both cultural and biological anthropologists. They found a consensus among them that biological races do not exist in humans, but that race does exist insofar as the social experiences of members of different races can have significant effects on health.[162]
Wang, Štrkalj et al. (2003) examined the use of race as a biological concept in research papers published in China's only biological anthropology journal, Acta Anthropologica Sinica. The study showed that the race concept was widely used among Chinese anthropologists.[163][164] In a 2007 review paper, Štrkalj suggested that the stark contrast of the racial approach between the United States and China was due to the fact that race is a factor for social cohesion among the ethnically diverse people of China, whereas "race" is a very sensitive issue in America and the racial approach is considered to undermine social cohesion – with the result that in the socio-political context of US academics scientists are encouraged not to use racial categories, whereas in China they are encouraged to use them.[165]
Lieberman et al. in a 2004 study researched the acceptance of race as a concept among anthropologists in the United States, Canada, the Spanish speaking areas, Europe, Russia and China. Rejection of race ranged from high to low, with the highest rejection rate in the United States and Canada, a moderate rejection rate in Europe, and the lowest rejection rate in Russia and China. Methods used in the studies reported included questionnaires and content analysis.[21]
Kaszycka et al. (2009) in 2002–2003 surveyed European anthropologists' opinions toward the biological race concept. Three factors – country of academic education, discipline, and age – were found to be significant in differentiating the replies. Those educated in Western Europe, physical anthropologists, and middle-aged persons rejected race more frequently than those educated in Eastern Europe, people in other branches of science, and those from both younger and older generations. "The survey shows that the views on race are sociopolitically (ideologically) influenced and highly dependent on education."[166]
Since the second half of the 20th century, physical anthropology in the United States has moved away from a typological understanding of human biological diversity towards a genomic and population-based perspective. Anthropologists have tended to understand race as a social classification of humans based on phenotype and ancestry as well as cultural factors, as the concept is understood in the social sciences.[92][160] Since 1932, an increasing number of college textbooks introducing physical anthropology have rejected race as a valid concept: from 1932 to 1976, only seven out of thirty-two rejected race; from 1975 to 1984, thirteen out of thirty-three rejected race; from 1985 to 1993, thirteen out of nineteen rejected race. According to one academic journal entry, where 78 percent of the articles in the 1931 Journal of Physical Anthropology employed these or nearly synonymous terms reflecting a bio-race paradigm, only 36 percent did so in 1965, and just 28 percent did in 1996.[167]
A 1998 "Statement on 'Race'" composed by a select committee of anthropologists and issued by the executive board of the American Anthropological Association, which they argue "represents generally the contemporary thinking and scholarly positions of a majority of anthropologists", declares:[168]
In the United States both scholars and the general public have been conditioned to viewing human races as natural and separate divisions within the human species based on visible physical differences. With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, however, it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. Evidence from the analysis of genetics (e.g., DNA) indicates that most physical variation, about 94%, lies within so-called racial groups. Conventional geographic "racial" groupings differ from one another only in about 6% of their genes. This means that there is greater variation within "racial" groups than between them. In neighboring populations there is much overlapping of genes and their phenotypic (physical) expressions. Throughout history whenever different groups have come into contact, they have interbred. The continued sharing of genetic materials has maintained all of humankind as a single species. ... With the vast expansion of scientific knowledge in this century, ... it has become clear that human populations are not unambiguous, clearly demarcated, biologically distinct groups. ... Given what we know about the capacity of normal humans to achieve and function within any culture, we conclude that present-day inequalities between so-called "racial" groups are not consequences of their biological inheritance but products of historical and contemporary social, economic, educational, and political circumstances.
An earlier survey, conducted in 1985 (Lieberman et al. 1992), asked 1,200 American scientists how many disagree with the following proposition: "There are biological races in the species Homo sapiens." Among anthropologists, the responses were:
Lieberman's study also showed that more women reject the concept of race than men.[170]
The same survey, conducted again in 1999,[171] showed that the number of anthropologists disagreeing with the idea of biological race had risen substantially. The results were as follows:
A line of research conducted by Cartmill (1998), however, seemed to limit the scope of Lieberman's finding that there was "a significant degree of change in the status of the race concept". Goran Štrkalj has argued that this may be because Lieberman and collaborators had looked at all the members of the American Anthropological Association irrespective of their field of research interest, while Cartmill had looked specifically at biological anthropologists interested in human variation.[172]
In 2007, Ann Morning interviewed over 40 American biologists and anthropologists and found significant disagreements over the nature of race, with no one viewpoint holding a majority among either group. Morning also argues that a third position, "antiessentialism", which holds that race is not a useful concept for biologists, should be introduced into this debate in addition to "constructionism" and "essentialism".[173]
According to the 2000 University of Wyoming edition of a popular physical anthropology textbook, forensic anthropologists are overwhelmingly in support of the idea of the basic biological reality of human races.[174] Forensic physical anthropologist and professor George W. Gill has said that the idea that race is only skin deep "is simply not true, as any experienced forensic anthropologist will affirm" and "Many morphological features tend to follow geographic boundaries coinciding often with climatic zones. This is not surprising since the selective forces of climate are probably the primary forces of nature that have shaped human races with regard not only to skin color and hair form but also the underlying bony structures of the nose, cheekbones, etc. (For example, more prominent noses humidify air better.)" While he can see good arguments for both sides, the complete denial of the opposing evidence "seems to stem largely from socio-political motivation and not science at all". He also states that many biological anthropologists see races as real yet "not one introductory textbook of physical anthropology even presents that perspective as a possibility. In a case as flagrant as this, we are not dealing with science but rather with blatant, politically motivated censorship".[174]
In partial response to Gill's statement, Professor of Biological Anthropology C. Loring Brace argues that the reason laymen and biological anthropologists can determine the geographic ancestry of an individual can be explained by the fact that biological characteristics are clinally distributed across the planet, and that does not translate into the concept of race. He states:
Well, you may ask, why can't we call those regional patterns "races"? In fact, we can and do, but it does not make them coherent biological entities. "Races" defined in such a way are products of our perceptions. ... We realize that in the extremes of our transit – Moscow to Nairobi, perhaps – there is a major but gradual change in skin color from what we euphemistically call white to black, and that this is related to the latitudinal difference in the intensity of the ultraviolet component of sunlight. What we do not see, however, is the myriad other traits that are distributed in a fashion quite unrelated to the intensity of ultraviolet radiation. Where skin color is concerned, all the northern populations of the Old World are lighter than the long-term inhabitants near the equator. Although Europeans and Chinese are obviously different, in skin color they are closer to each other than either is to equatorial Africans. But if we test the distribution of the widely known ABO blood-group system, then Europeans and Africans are closer to each other than either is to Chinese.[175]
The concept of "race" is still sometimes used within forensic anthropology (when analyzing skeletal remains), biomedical research, and race-based medicine.[176][177] Brace has criticized forensic anthropologists for this, arguing that they in fact should be talking about regional ancestry. He argues that while forensic anthropologists can determine that a skeletal remain comes from a person with ancestors in a specific region of Africa, categorizing that skeletal as being "black" is a socially constructed category that is only meaningful in the particular social context of the United States, and which is not itself scientifically valid.[178]
In the same 1985 survey (Lieberman et al. 1992), 16% of the surveyed biologists and 36% of the surveyed developmental psychologists disagreed with the proposition: "There are biological races in the species Homo sapiens."
The authors of the study also examined 77 college textbooks in biology and 69 in physical anthropology published between 1932 and 1989. Physical anthropology texts argued that biological races exist until the 1970s, when they began to argue that races do not exist. In contrast, biology textbooks did not undergo such a reversal but many instead dropped their discussion of race altogether. The authors attributed this to biologists trying to avoid discussing the political implications of racial classifications, and to the ongoing discussions in biology about the validity of the idea of "subspecies". The authors concluded, "The concept of race, masking the overwhelming genetic similarity of all peoples and the mosaic patterns of variation that do not correspond to racial divisions, is not only socially dysfunctional but is biologically indefensible as well (pp. 5 18–5 19)."(Lieberman et al. 1992, pp. 316–17)
A 1994 examination of 32 English sport/exercise science textbooks found that 7 (21.9%) claimed that there are biophysical differences due to race that might explain differences in sports performance, 24 (75%) did not mention nor refute the concept, and 1 (3.1%) expressed caution with the idea.[179]
In February 2001, the editors of Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine asked "authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or sociological reason for doing so".[180] The editors also stated that "analysis by race and ethnicity has become an analytical knee-jerk reflex".[181] Nature Genetics now ask authors to "explain why they make use of particular ethnic groups or populations, and how classification was achieved".[182]
Morning (2008) looked at high school biology textbooks during the 1952–2002 period and initially found a similar pattern with only 35% directly discussing race in the 1983–92 period from initially 92% doing so. However, this has increased somewhat after this to 43%. More indirect and brief discussions of race in the context of medical disorders have increased from none to 93% of textbooks. In general, the material on race has moved from surface traits to genetics and evolutionary history. The study argues that the textbooks' fundamental message about the existence of races has changed little.[183]
Surveying views on race in the scientific community in 2008, Morning concluded that biologists had failed to come to a clear consensus, and they often split along cultural and demographic lines. She notes: "At best, one can conclude that biologists and anthropologists now appear equally divided in their beliefs about the nature of race."[173]
Gissis (2008) examined several important American and British journals in genetics, epidemiology and medicine for their content during the 1946–2003 period. He wrote that "Based upon my findings I argue that the category of race only seemingly disappeared from scientific discourse after World War II and has had a fluctuating yet continuous use during the time span from 1946 to 2003, and has even become more pronounced from the early 1970s on".[184]
33 health services researchers from differing geographic regions were interviewed in a 2008 study. The researchers recognized the problems with racial and ethnic variables but the majority still believed these variables were necessary and useful.[185]
A 2010 examination of 18 widely used English anatomy textbooks found that they all represented human biological variation in superficial and outdated ways, many of them making use of the race concept in ways that were current in 1950s anthropology. The authors recommended that anatomical education should describe human anatomical variation in more detail and rely on newer research that demonstrates the inadequacies of simple racial typologies.[186]
A 2021 study that examined over 11,000 papers from 1949 to 2018 in the American Journal of Human Genetics, found that "race" was used in only 5% of papers published in the last decade, down from 22% in the first. Together with an increase in use of the terms "ethnicity", "ancestry", and location-based terms, it suggests that human geneticists have mostly abandoned the term "race".[187]
The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine (NASEM), supported by the US the National Institutes of Health, formally declared that "researchers should not use race as a proxy for describing human genetic variation".[188] The report of its Committee on the Use of Race, Ethnicity, and Ancestry as Population Descriptors in Genomics Research titled Using Population Descriptors in Genetics and Genomics Research was released on 14 March 2023.[189][27] The report stated: "In humans, race is a socially constructed designation, a misleading and harmful surrogate for population genetic differences, and has a long history of being incorrectly identified as the major genetic reason for phenotypic differences between groups."[3] The committee co-chair Charmaine D. Royal and Robert O. Keohane of Duke University agreed in the meeting: "Classifying people by race is a practice entangled with and rooted in racism."[188]
Lester Frank Ward (1841–1913), considered to be one of the founders of American sociology, rejected notions that there were fundamental differences that distinguished one race from another, although he acknowledged that social conditions differed dramatically by race.[190] At the turn of the 20th century, sociologists viewed the concept of race in ways that were shaped by the scientific racism of the 19th and early 20th centuries.[191] Many sociologists focused on African Americans, called Negroes at that time, and claimed that they were inferior to whites. White sociologist Charlotte Perkins Gilman (1860–1935), for example, used biological arguments to claim the inferiority of African Americans.[191] American sociologist Charles H. Cooley (1864–1929) theorized that differences among races were "natural", and that biological differences result in differences in intellectual abilities.[192][190] Edward Alsworth Ross (1866–1951), also an important figure in the founding of American sociology, and a eugenicist, believed that whites were the superior race, and that there were essential differences in "temperament" among races.[190] In 1910, the Journal published an article by Ulysses G. Weatherly (1865–1940) that called for white supremacy and segregation of the races to protect racial purity.[190]
W. E. B. Du Bois (1868–1963), one of the first African-American sociologists, was the first sociologist to use sociological concepts and empirical research methods to analyze race as a social construct instead of a biological reality.[191] Beginning in 1899 with his book The Philadelphia Negro, Du Bois studied and wrote about race and racism throughout his career. In his work, he contended that social class, colonialism, and capitalism shaped ideas about race and racial categories. Social scientists largely abandoned scientific racism and biological reasons for racial categorization schemes by the 1930s.[193] Other early sociologists, especially those associated with the Chicago School, joined Du Bois in theorizing race as a socially constructed fact.[193] By 1978, William Julius Wilson argued that race and racial classification systems were declining in significance, and that instead, social class more accurately described what sociologists had earlier understood as race.[194] By 1986, sociologists Michael Omi and Howard Winant successfully introduced the concept of racial formation to describe the process by which racial categories are created.[195] Omi and Winant assert that "there is no biological basis for distinguishing among human groups along the lines of race".[195]
Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, Sociology professor at Duke University, remarks:[196] "I contend that racism is, more than anything else, a matter of group power; it is about a dominant racial group (whites) striving to maintain its systemic advantages and minorities fighting to subvert the racial status quo."[197] The types of practices that take place under this new color-blind racism is subtle, institutionalized, and supposedly not racial. Color-blind racism thrives on the idea that race is no longer an issue in the United States.[197] There are contradictions between the alleged color-blindness of most whites and the persistence of a color-coded system of inequality.[citation needed]
Today, sociologists generally understand race and racial categories as socially constructed, and reject racial categorization schemes that depend on biological differences.[193]
In the United States, federal government policy promotes the use of racially categorized data to identify and address health disparities between racial or ethnic groups.[198] In clinical settings, race has sometimes been considered in the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions. Doctors have noted that some medical conditions are more prevalent in certain racial or ethnic groups than in others, without being sure of the cause of those differences. Recent interest in race-based medicine, or race-targeted pharmacogenomics, has been fueled by the proliferation of human genetic data which followed the decoding of the human genome in the first decade of the twenty-first century. There is an active debate among biomedical researchers about the meaning and importance of race in their research. Proponents of the use of racial categories in biomedicine argue that continued use of racial categorizations in biomedical research and clinical practice makes possible the application of new genetic findings, and provides a clue to diagnosis.[199][200] Biomedical researchers' positions on race fall into two main camps: those who consider the concept of race to have no biological basis and those who consider it to have the potential to be biologically meaningful. Members of the latter camp often base their arguments around the potential to create genome-based personalized medicine.[201]
Other researchers point out that finding a difference in disease prevalence between two socially defined groups does not necessarily imply genetic causation of the difference.[202][203] They suggest that medical practices should maintain their focus on the individual rather than an individual's membership to any group.[204] They argue that overemphasizing genetic contributions to health disparities carries various risks such as reinforcing stereotypes, promoting racism or ignoring the contribution of non-genetic factors to health disparities.[205] International epidemiological data show that living conditions rather than race make the biggest difference in health outcomes even for diseases that have "race-specific" treatments.[206] Some studies have found that patients are reluctant to accept racial categorization in medical practice.[200]
In an attempt to provide general descriptions that may facilitate the job of law enforcement officers seeking to apprehend suspects, the United States FBI employs the term "race" to summarize the general appearance (skin color, hair texture, eye shape, and other such easily noticed characteristics) of individuals whom they are attempting to apprehend. From the perspective of law enforcement officers, it is generally more important to arrive at a description that will readily suggest the general appearance of an individual than to make a scientifically valid categorization by DNA or other such means. Thus, in addition to assigning a wanted individual to a racial category, such a description will include: height, weight, eye color, scars and other distinguishing characteristics.
Criminal justice agencies in England and Wales use at least two separate racial/ethnic classification systems when reporting crime, as of 2010. One is the system used in the 2001 Census when individuals identify themselves as belonging to a particular ethnic group: W1 (White-British), W2 (White-Irish), W9 (Any other white background); M1 (White and black Caribbean), M2 (White and black African), M3 (White and Asian), M9 (Any other mixed background); A1 (Asian-Indian), A2 (Asian-Pakistani), A3 (Asian-Bangladeshi), A9 (Any other Asian background); B1 (Black Caribbean), B2 (Black African), B3 (Any other black background); O1 (Chinese), O9 (Any other). The other is categories used by the police when they visually identify someone as belonging to an ethnic group, e.g. at the time of a stop and search or an arrest: White – North European (IC1), White – South European (IC2), Black (IC3), Asian (IC4), Chinese, Japanese, or South East Asian (IC5), Middle Eastern (IC6), and Unknown (IC0). "IC" stands for "Identification Code;" these items are also referred to as Phoenix classifications.[207] Officers are instructed to "record the response that has been given" even if the person gives an answer which may be incorrect; their own perception of the person's ethnic background is recorded separately.[208] Comparability of the information being recorded by officers was brought into question by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) in September 2007, as part of its Equality Data Review; one problem cited was the number of reports that contained an ethnicity of "Not Stated".[209]
In many countries, such as France, the state is legally banned from maintaining data based on race.[210]
In the United States, the practice of racial profiling has been ruled to be both unconstitutional and a violation of civil rights. There is active debate regarding the cause of a marked correlation between the recorded crimes, punishments meted out, and the country's populations. Many consider de facto racial profiling an example of institutional racism in law enforcement.[211]
Mass incarceration in the United States disproportionately impacts African American and Latino communities. Michelle Alexander, author of The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness (2010), argues that mass incarceration is best understood as not only a system of overcrowded prisons. Mass incarceration is also, "the larger web of laws, rules, policies, and customs that control those labeled criminals both in and out of prison".[212] She defines it further as "a system that locks people not only behind actual bars in actual prisons, but also behind virtual bars and virtual walls", illustrating the second-class citizenship that is imposed on a disproportionate number of people of color, specifically African-Americans. She compares mass incarceration to Jim Crow laws, stating that both work as racial caste systems.[213]
Many research findings appear to agree that the impact of victim race in the interpersonal violence (IPV) arrest decision might include a racial bias in favor of white victims. A 2011 study in a national sample of IPV arrests found that female arrest was more likely if the male victim was white and the female offender was black, while male arrest was more likely if the female victim was white. For both female and male arrest in IPV cases, situations involving married couples were more likely to lead to arrest compared to dating or divorced couples. More research is needed to understand agency and community factors that influence police behavior and how discrepancies in IPV interventions/ tools of justice can be addressed.[214]
Recent work using DNA cluster analysis to determine race background has been used by some criminal investigators to narrow their search for the identity of both suspects and victims.[215] Proponents of DNA profiling in criminal investigations cite cases where leads based on DNA analysis proved useful, but the practice remains controversial among medical ethicists, defense lawyers and some in law enforcement.[216]
The Constitution of Australia contains a line about 'people of any race for whom it is deemed necessary to make special laws', despite there being no agreed definition of race described in the document.
Similarly, forensic anthropologists draw on highly heritable morphological features of human remains (e.g. cranial measurements) to aid in the identification of the body, including in terms of race. In a 1992 article, anthropologist Norman Sauer noted that anthropologists had generally abandoned the concept of race as a valid representation of human biological diversity, except for forensic anthropologists. He asked, "If races don't exist, why are forensic anthropologists so good at identifying them?"[161] He concluded:
[T]he successful assignment of race to a skeletal specimen is not a vindication of the race concept, but rather a prediction that an individual, while alive was assigned to a particular socially constructed "racial" category. A specimen may display features that point to African ancestry. In this country that person is likely to have been labeled Black regardless of whether or not such a race actually exists in nature.[161]
Identification of the ancestry of an individual is dependent upon knowledge of the frequency and distribution of phenotypic traits in a population. This does not necessitate the use of a racial classification scheme based on unrelated traits, although the race concept is widely used in medical and legal contexts in the United States.[217] Some studies have reported that races can be identified with a high degree of accuracy using certain methods, such as that developed by Giles and Elliot. However, this method sometimes fails to be replicated in other times and places; for instance, when the method was re-tested to identify Native Americans, the average rate of accuracy dropped from 85% to 33%.[78] Prior information about the individual (e.g. Census data) is also important in allowing the accurate identification of the individual's "race".[218]
In a different approach, anthropologist C. Loring Brace said:
The simple answer is that, as members of the society that poses the question, they are inculcated into the social conventions that determine the expected answer. They should also be aware of the biological inaccuracies contained in that "politically correct" answer. Skeletal analysis provides no direct assessment of skin color, but it does allow an accurate estimate of original geographical origins. African, eastern Asian, and European ancestry can be specified with a high degree of accuracy. Africa of course entails "black", but "black" does not entail African.[178]
In association with a NOVA program in 2000 about race, he wrote an essay opposing use of the term.[219]
A 2002 study found that about 13% of human craniometric variation existed between regions, while 6% existed between local populations within regions and 81% within local populations. In contrast, the opposite pattern of genetic variation was observed for skin color (which is often used to define race), with 88% of variation between regions. The study concluded: "The apportionment of genetic diversity in skin color is atypical, and cannot be used for purposes of classification."[220] Similarly, a 2009 study found that craniometrics could be used accurately to determine what part of the world someone was from based on their cranium; however, this study also found that there were no abrupt boundaries that separated craniometric variation into distinct racial groups.[221] Another 2009 study showed that American blacks and whites had different skeletal morphologies, and that significant patterning in variation in these traits exists within continents. This suggests that classifying humans into races based on skeletal characteristics would necessitate many different "races" being defined.[222]
In 2010, philosopher Neven Sesardić argued that when several traits are analyzed at the same time, forensic anthropologists can classify a person's race with an accuracy of close to 100% based on only skeletal remains.[223] Sesardić's claim has been disputed by philosopher Massimo Pigliucci, who accused Sesardić of "cherry pick[ing] the scientific evidence and reach[ing] conclusions that are contradicted by it". Specifically, Pigliucci argued that Sesardić misrepresented a paper by Ousley et al. (2009), and neglected to mention that they identified differentiation not just between individuals from different races, but also between individuals from different tribes, local environments, and time periods.[224]

The genetic differences that exist among populations are characterized by gradual changes across geographic regions, not sharp, categorical distinctions. Groups of people across the globe have varying frequencies of polymorphic genes, which are genes with any of several differing nucleotide sequences. There is no such thing as a set of genes that belongs exclusively to one group and not to another. The clinal, gradually changing nature of geographic genetic difference is complicated further by the migration and mixing that human groups have engaged in since prehistory. Human beings do not fit the zoological definition of race. A mountain of evidence assembled by historians, anthropologists, and biologists proves that race is not and cannot be a natural division of human beings.

The DNA differences between humans increase with geographical distance, but boundaries between populations are, as geneticists Kenneth Weiss and Jeffrey Long put it, "multilayered, porous, ephemeral, and difficult to identify". Pure, geographically separated ancestral populations are an abstraction: "There is no reason to think that there ever were isolated, homogeneous parental populations at any time in our human past."

The relationship between self-reported identity and genetic African ancestry, as well as the low numbers of self-reported African Americans with minor levels of African ancestry, provide insight into the complexity of genetic and social consequences of racial categorization, assortative mating, and the impact of notions of "race" on patterns of mating and self-identity in the US. Our results provide empirical support that, over recent centuries, many individuals with partial African and Native American ancestry have "passed" into the white community, with multiple lines of evidence establishing African and Native American ancestry in self-reported European Americans.

Groundbreaking advances in DNA sequencing technology have been made over the last two decades. These advances enable us to measure with exquisite accuracy what fraction of an individual's genetic ancestry traces back to, say, West Africa 500 years ago – before the mixing in the Americas of the West African and European gene pools that were almost completely isolated for the last 70,000 years. With the help of these tools, we are learning that while race may be a social construct, differences in genetic ancestry that happen to correlate to many of today's racial constructs are real. Recent genetic studies have demonstrated differences across populations not just in the genetic determinants of simple traits such as skin color, but also in more complex traits like bodily dimensions and susceptibility to diseases.

The ancients would not understand the social construct we call 'race' any more than they would understand the distinction modem scholars and social scientists generally draw between race and 'ethnicity.' The modern concept of race is a product of the colonial enterprises of European powers from the 16th to 18th centuries that identified race in terms of skin color and physical difference. In the post-Enlightenment world, a 'scientific,' biological idea of race suggested that human difference could be explained by biologically distinct groups of humans, evolved from separate origins, who could be distinguished by physical differences, predominantly skin color .... Such categorizations would have confused the ancient Greeks and Romans.

The Invention of Race: Scientific and Popular Representations. Routledge. p. 11. ISBN 978-0-367-20864-6. 'The Invention of Race' has assisted us in the process of locating the 'epistemological moment,' somewhere between 1730 and 1790, when the concept of race was invented and rationalized. A "moment" that was accompanied by a revolution in the way in which the human body was studied and observed in order to formulate scientific conclusions relating to human variability.

(Summarizing Edwards' thesis): We can all happily agree that human racial classification is of no social value and is positively destructive of social and human relations. That is one reason why I object to ticking boxes on forms and why I object to positive discrimination in job selection. But that doesn't mean that race is of 'virtually no genetic or taxonomic significance.' This is Edwards's point, and he reasons as follows. However small the racial partition of total variation may be, if such racial characteristics as there are highly correlated with other racial characteristics, they are by definition informative, and therefore of taxonomic significance.

In future issues of the Archives, we ask authors to not use race and ethnicity when there is no biological, scientific, or sociological reason for doing so. Race or ethnicity should not be used as explanatory variables, when the underlying constructs are variables that can, and should, be measured directly (eg, educational level of subjects, household income of the families, single vs 2-parent households, employment of parents, owning vs renting one's home, and other measures of socioeconomic status). In contrast, the recent attention on decreasing health disparities uses race and ethnicity not as explanatory variables but as ways of examining the underlying sociocultural reasons for these disparities and appropriately targeting attention and resources on children and adolescents with poorer health. In select issues and questions such as these, use of race and ethnicity is appropriate.

In summary, they argues that, in order to predict the clinical success of pharmacogenomic research, scholars must conduct subsidiary research on two fronts: Science, wherein the degree of correspondence between popular and professional racial categories can be assessed; and society at large, through which attitudinal factors moderate the relationship between scientific soundness and societal acceptance. To accept race-as-proxy, then, may be necessary but insufficient to solidify the future of race-based pharmacogenomics.

"For example, what are we to make of the fact that African Americans suffer from disproportionately high rates of hypertension, but Africans in Nigeria have among the world's lowest rates of hypertension, far lower than the overwhelmingly white population of Germany? Genetics certainly plays a role in hypertension. But any role it plays in explaining such differences must surely be vanishingly small."

Craniometric variation is geographically structured, allowing high levels of classification accuracy when comparing crania from different parts of the world. Nonetheless, the boundaries in global variation are not abrupt and do not fit a strict view of the race concept; the number of races and the cutoffs used to define them are arbitrary.

Author of Race in North America: Origin and Evolution of a Worldview. Audrey SmedleyAll Fact-checked by Britannica Editors Encyclopaedia Britannica's editors oversee subject areas in which they have extensive knowledge, whether from years of experience gained by working on that content or via study for an advanced degree.... Britannica Editors Last updated Oct. 24, 2025 •History race, the idea that the human species is divided into distinct groups on the basis of inherited physical and behavioral differences. Genetic studies in the late 20th century refuted the existence of biogenetically distinct races, and scholars now argue that “races” are cultural interventions reflecting specific attitudes and beliefs that were imposed on different populations in the wake of western European conquests beginning in the 15th century. The many meanings of “race” The modern meaning of the term race with reference to humans began to emerge in the 17th century. Since then it has had a variety of meanings in the languages of the Western world. What most definitions have in common is an attempt to categorize peoples primarily by their physical differences. In the United States, for example, the term race generally refers to a group of people who have in common some visible physical traits, such as skin color, hair texture, facial features, and eye shape. Such distinctive features are associated with large, geographically separated populations, and these continental aggregates are also designated as races, as the “African race,” the “European race,” and the “Asian race.” Many people think of race as reflective of any visible physical (phenotypic) variations among human groups, regardless of the cultural context and even in the absence of fixed racial categories. The term race has also been applied to linguistic groups (the “Arab race” or the “Latin race”), to religious groups (the “Jewish race”), and even to political, national, or ethnic groups with few or no physical traits that distinguish them from their neighbors (the “Irish race,” the “French race,” the “Spanish race,” the “Slavic race,” the “Chinese race”, etc.). For much of the 20th century, scientists in the Western world attempted to identify, describe, and classify human races and to document their differences and the relationships between them. Some scientists used the term race for subspecies, subdivisions of the human species which were presumed sufficiently different biologically that they might later evolve into separate species. At no point, from the first rudimentary attempts at classifying human populations in the 17th and 18th centuries to the present day, have scientists agreed on the number of races of humankind, the features to be used in the identification of races, or the meaning of race itself. Experts have suggested a range of different races varying from 3 to more than 60, based on what they have considered distinctive differences in physical characteristics alone (these include hair type, head shape, skin color, height, and so on). The lack of concurrence on the meaning and identification of races continued into the 21st century, and contemporary scientists are no closer to agreement than their forebears. Thus, race has never in the history of its use had a precise meaning. Although most people continue to think of races as physically distinct populations, scientific advances in the 20th century demonstrated that human physical variations do not fit a “racial” model. Instead, human physical variations tend to overlap. There are no genes that can identify distinct groups that accord with the conventional race categories. In fact, DNA analyses have proved that all humans have much more in common, genetically, than they have differences. The genetic difference between any two humans is less than 1 percent. Moreover, geographically widely separated populations vary from one another in only about 6 to 8 percent of their genes. Because of the overlapping of traits that bear no relationship to one another (such as skin color and hair texture) and the inability of scientists to cluster peoples into discrete racial packages, modern researchers have concluded that the concept of race has no biological validity. Key People: Franz Boas Sir Edward Burnett Tylor Kwame Anthony Appiah Roland B. Dixon Ashley Montagu Related Topics: mulatto brown babies pardo mestizo social differentiation by race See all related content Many scholars in other disciplines accept this scientific understanding of biological diversity in the human species. Moreover, they have long understood that the concept of race as relating solely to phenotypic traits encompasses neither the social reality of race nor the phenomenon of “racism.” Prompted by advances in other fields, particularly anthropology and history, scholars began to examine race as a social and cultural, rather than biological, phenomenon and have determined that race is a social invention of relatively recent origin. It derives its most salient characteristics from the social consequences of its classificatory use. The idea of “race” began to evolve in the late 17th century, after the beginning of European exploration and colonization, as a folk ideology about human differences associated with the different populations—Europeans, Indigenous Americans, and Africans—brought together in the New World. In the 19th century, after the abolition of slavery, the ideology fully emerged as a new mechanism of social division and stratification. Access for the whole family!

Analysis of the folk beliefs, social policies, and practices of North Americans about race from the 18th to the 20th century reveals the development of a unique and fundamental ideology about human differences. This ideology or “racial worldview” is a systematic, institutionalized set of beliefs and attitudes that includes the following components: All the world’s peoples can be divided into biologically separate, discrete, and exclusive populations called races. A person can belong to only one race.Phenotypic features, or visible physical differences, are markers or symbols of race identity and status. Because an individual may belong to a racial category and not have any or all of the associated physical features, racial scientists early in the 20th century invented an invisible internal element, “racial essence,” to explain such anomalies.Each race has distinct qualities of temperament, morality, disposition, and intellectual ability. Consequently, in the popular imagination each race has distinct behavioral traits that are linked to its phenotype.Races are unequal. They can, and should, be ranked on a gradient of inferiority and superiority. As the 19th-century biologist Louis Agassiz observed, since races exist, we must “settle the relative rank among [them].”The behavioral and physical attributes of each race are inherited and innate—therefore fixed, permanent, and unalterable.Distinct races should be segregated and allowed to develop their own institutions, communities, and lifestyles, separate from those of other races. These are the beliefs that wax and wane but never entirely disappear from the core of the American version of race differences. From its inception, racial ideology accorded inferior social status to people of African or Native American ancestry. This ideology was institutionalized in law and social practice, and social mechanisms were developed for enforcing the status differences. South Africa Although race categories and racial ideology are both arbitrary and subjective, race was a convenient way to organize people within structures of presumed permanent inequality. South Africa’s policy of apartheid exhibited the same basic racial ideology as the North American system but differed in two respects: the systematic state classification of races and the creation of an intermediate “racial” category; the Coloured category, for historical reasons, was made distinct and defined as those who were neither Black (called Bantus or natives), most of whom retained their own traditional cultures, nor white (Europeans), who brought different cultural forms to South Africa. The relative exclusiveness of South Africa’s race categories was compromised by an institutionalized mechanism for changing one’s race, the Race Classification Board established by the Population Registration Act of 1950. This body, unique to South Africa, adjudicated questionable classifications and reassigned racial identities to individuals.

“Race” and the reality of human physical variation
Modern scientific explanations of human biological variation
race, the idea that the human species is divided into distinct groups on the basis of inherited physical and behavioral differences. Genetic studies in the late 20th century refuted the existence of biogenetically distinct races, and scholars now argue that “races” are cultural interventions reflecting specific attitudes and beliefs that were imposed on different populations in the wake of western European conquests beginning in the 15th century.
The modern meaning of the term race with reference to humans began to emerge in the 17th century. Since then it has had a variety of meanings in the languages of the Western world. What most definitions have in common is an attempt to categorize peoples primarily by their physical differences. In the United States, for example, the term race generally refers to a group of people who have in common some visible physical traits, such as skin color, hair texture, facial features, and eye shape. Such distinctive features are associated with large, geographically separated populations, and these continental aggregates are also designated as races, as the “African race,” the “European race,” and the “Asian race.” Many people think of race as reflective of any visible physical (phenotypic) variations among human groups, regardless of the cultural context and even in the absence of fixed racial categories.
The term race has also been applied to linguistic groups (the “Arab race” or the “Latin race”), to religious groups (the “Jewish race”), and even to political, national, or ethnic groups with few or no physical traits that distinguish them from their neighbors (the “Irish race,” the “French race,” the “Spanish race,” the “Slavic race,” the “Chinese race”, etc.).
For much of the 20th century, scientists in the Western world attempted to identify, describe, and classify human races and to document their differences and the relationships between them. Some scientists used the term race for subspecies, subdivisions of the human species which were presumed sufficiently different biologically that they might later evolve into separate species.
At no point, from the first rudimentary attempts at classifying human populations in the 17th and 18th centuries to the present day, have scientists agreed on the number of races of humankind, the features to be used in the identification of races, or the meaning of race itself. Experts have suggested a range of different races varying from 3 to more than 60, based on what they have considered distinctive differences in physical characteristics alone (these include hair type, head shape, skin color, height, and so on). The lack of concurrence on the meaning and identification of races continued into the 21st century, and contemporary scientists are no closer to agreement than their forebears. Thus, race has never in the history of its use had a precise meaning.
Although most people continue to think of races as physically distinct populations, scientific advances in the 20th century demonstrated that human physical variations do not fit a “racial” model. Instead, human physical variations tend to overlap. There are no genes that can identify distinct groups that accord with the conventional race categories. In fact, DNA analyses have proved that all humans have much more in common, genetically, than they have differences. The genetic difference between any two humans is less than 1 percent. Moreover, geographically widely separated populations vary from one another in only about 6 to 8 percent of their genes. Because of the overlapping of traits that bear no relationship to one another (such as skin color and hair texture) and the inability of scientists to cluster peoples into discrete racial packages, modern researchers have concluded that the concept of race has no biological validity.
Many scholars in other disciplines accept this scientific understanding of biological diversity in the human species. Moreover, they have long understood that the concept of race as relating solely to phenotypic traits encompasses neither the social reality of race nor the phenomenon of “racism.” Prompted by advances in other fields, particularly anthropology and history, scholars began to examine race as a social and cultural, rather than biological, phenomenon and have determined that race is a social invention of relatively recent origin. It derives its most salient characteristics from the social consequences of its classificatory use. The idea of “race” began to evolve in the late 17th century, after the beginning of European exploration and colonization, as a folk ideology about human differences associated with the different populations—Europeans, Indigenous Americans, and Africans—brought together in the New World. In the 19th century, after the abolition of slavery, the ideology fully emerged as a new mechanism of social division and stratification.

The Difference between 'Race' and 'Ethnicity' How they differ and overlap What to Know Today, race refers to a group sharing some outward physical characteristics and some commonalities of culture and history. Ethnicity refers to markers acquired from the group with which one shares cultural, traditional, and familial bonds. When filling out an application or legal form, you might be asked what race, in addition to what ethnicity, you identify with. While mechanically checking off the boxes or writing in your responses, you might momentarily stop and wonder, "What's the official difference?"—before continuing on. The History and Meaning of 'Race' The word race on the form refers to the group or groups that you may identify with as having similar physical traits that are regarded as common among people of a shared ancestry, or as stated by The United States Census Bureau: First, the [2020 US Census] question [about race] is based on how you identify. Second, the race categories generally reflect social definitions in the U.S. and are not an attempt to define race biologically, anthropologically, or genetically. We recognize that the race categories include racial and national origins and sociocultural groups. In the past, race often referred to the group with which you share a similar cultural background, language, religion, or geographical origin.

In other words, it is meant to get an idea about your nationality, heritage, culture, ancestry, and upbringing. The concept of ethnicity contrasts with that of race in that it is concerned with group cultural identity or expression whereas race focuses on physical and genetic traits.

By Joshua N Published on February 27, 2023 As visual beings, humans tend to appreciate the aesthetics of the female form, particularly (straight) men who often express their admiration for every aspect of it. Nevertheless, breasts and buttocks receive the most focus, with a preference for larger sizes. Men seem to instinctively know where to direct their gaze, whether the woman is fully clothed or dressed up. This fixation can be attributed to several factors that contribute to their fascination with these body parts. 1. Cuddling Becomes A Lot Happier When Boobs And Butts Are Involved Based on my observation as a heterosexual woman, I have noticed that men find comfort and arousal from fondling or cuddling with breasts. For instance, during a spooning session, when a woman's buttocks presses against the man's intimate areas, he may desire to escalate the cuddling experience by fondling her breasts. The level of pleasure seems to increase with the size of the breasts. 2. Boobs And Butts Are Often Off-limits, Which Draws Men To Them It's a common trait of human nature to desire what is forbidden. In a man's perfect fantasy world, he may spend his time indulging in playful behavior like slapping butts and fondling breasts without any limits, but when he returns to reality, he understands that such actions are strictly prohibited, making them even more alluring. 3. Men Love Getting Creative With These Body Parts Although not all women may share the same level of appreciation for large breasts and buttocks as men, it's not a significant concern. For males, a well-rounded derriere with the right amount of jiggle and ample, bouncy breasts can be incredibly mesmerizing and serve multiple functions. A sizeable posterior can double as a soft pillow, a stress-relieving squeeze toy, a hand warmer, and a comfortable spot for hands to rest. On the other hand, big breasts are often played with, used as a comfortable resting place, or just admired. It may seem unusual, but it's undoubtedly accurate. 4. Men View Female Bodies Differently As women, we may be aware of the challenges associated with having large breasts or buttocks, but men seem to be oblivious to these issues and tend to prefer women with a fuller figure. Men can be fixated on certain body parts, unable to determine the ideal size or shape because of their obsession. They love breasts and buttocks in all forms, but larger or more curvaceous ones are often viewed as a bonus. 5. They Think Big Boobs And Butts Contribute To A Woman's Sex Appeal There's a certain allure to the hourglass figure, at least in the eyes of men. If hourglasses were shaped like squares or rectangles, they would still serve their purpose, but they wouldn't be as aesthetically pleasing. Men tend to be visually-driven creatures with linear thinking patterns. Large breasts and buttocks have long been associated with beauty and sex appeal, and many men consider women with such features to be sexual symbols. As unintelligent as it may seem, these perceptions persist in society. 6. Men Think Big Boobs And Butts Are A Sign Of Fertility In evolutionary terms, a bigger butt usually implies wider hips, which might make childbirth easier. Similarly, the notion is that bigger breasts would produce more milk to nourish potential offspring (which is not entirely accurate, but that's beside the point). Therefore, the primitive instinct of men is to be drawn to women with these attributes. 7. Big Boobs And Butts Are Strong Visual Turn-ons I won't deny that large breasts and buttocks have always been linked to femininity and are potent visual stimulants. Even if you don't find them sexually attractive, your gaze will naturally follow a woman with such features as she passes by, regardless of your gender. In contrast, a man may maintain a cool demeanor, but internally, his jaw may drop, and his tongue may wag. Men have been infatuated with breasts and buttocks in all shapes and sizes since the dawn of time, so ladies, embrace your assets with confidence.

LifestyleThere's Finally An Answer To Why Men Are Either Boob Guys Or Ass Guysby Dan ScottiFeb. 19, 2015Sony PIcturesWould you rather be famous or rich? Coke or Pepsi? The cookie part of the Oreo, or the icing?With respect to certain matters of life, like the few I just mentioned, people will either fall into one of two distinct categories, ya know, “this” or “that.” Regarding women, and our own unique preferences, men will face these types of scenarios in bunches.Thick or thin? Sporty or stylish? And mustn’t we forget the classic debate over blonde or brunette.Personally – unless she looks like Kate Moss, fully equipped with a cigarette fixed between her lips – I’ll take a tan-skinned, dark-haired goddess any day of the week.With that said, I have plenty of friends who live life with a “blonde way or the highway” mentality.There’s no right or wrong, really, it’s a matter of preference. I will say, however, these preferences can sometimes reveal deeper aspects of your character.For instance, if you’re into girls who are sporty – there’s a good chance you’re sporty yourself and enjoy spending time with people who share similar interests to you.If you’re into a girl who drinks whiskey, as opposed to, I don’t know, white wine – maybe you choose to seek out strong, full bodied, women because you’re equally as passionate yourself. Or, maybe you’re just compensating – who knows.Either way, our preference in women will always reflect upon ourselves, at the end of the day. So, what does the preference on every guy’s mind – but maybe left out of formal conversation ultimately say about us?

There's Finally An Answer To Why Men Are Either Boob Guys Or Ass Guys
Would you rather be famous or rich? Coke or Pepsi? The cookie part of the Oreo, or the icing?
With respect to certain matters of life, like the few I just mentioned, people will either fall into one of two distinct categories, ya know, “this” or “that.” Regarding women, and our own unique preferences, men will face these types of scenarios in bunches.
Thick or thin? Sporty or stylish? And mustn’t we forget the classic debate over blonde or brunette.
Personally – unless she looks like Kate Moss, fully equipped with a cigarette fixed between her lips – I’ll take a tan-skinned, dark-haired goddess any day of the week.
With that said, I have plenty of friends who live life with a “blonde way or the highway” mentality.
There’s no right or wrong, really, it’s a matter of preference. I will say, however, these preferences can sometimes reveal deeper aspects of your character.
For instance, if you’re into girls who are sporty – there’s a good chance you’re sporty yourself and enjoy spending time with people who share similar interests to you.
If you’re into a girl who drinks whiskey, as opposed to, I don’t know, white wine – maybe you choose to seek out strong, full bodied, women because you’re equally as passionate yourself. Or, maybe you’re just compensating – who knows.
Either way, our preference in women will always reflect upon ourselves, at the end of the day. So, what does the preference on every guy’s mind – but maybe left out of formal conversation ultimately say about us? Oh yeah, I’m talking about breasts or butts.
This controversy is far from a new one, in fact, I’m sure God nudged Adam and broached the subject – before creating Eve – just to see where he stood on the subject.
And, while everyone typically has an opinion or something to say regarding the matter, it’s more or less been unclear for what this opinion says about us.
It’s time for science to weigh in. Gene Expression, a blog specializing in all things genetics, explored the different physical preferences men will have about women’s bodies – along with their deeper meanings.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that the experiment conducted in this case was from the late 60s – so, I’m really not sure how applicable the data crunched in this study are to the present day.
Regardless, it’s something to keep in mind next time you’re scouting out your next girl.
All right, so – according to Wiggins et. al – if you live and die by a pair of big boobs, you also probably read a lot of sports magazines. Which, more or less, shocks nobody.
In the study at hand, a large breast preference was correlated highly with a need for exhibitionism.
In other words, dudes who call themselves “breast-men,” and favor women who are well endowed upstairs, are also usually the ones roaming around the room figuring out ways to become the center of attention.
Independence is key for the “breast-man,” which is ironic considering the object of their desire (almost always) comes in pairs of two.
Nevertheless, in social situations, these types of guys usually have no problem exchanging witty banter and holding their own, by themselves.
One interesting finding that Wiggins et. al pointed out relies upon the finer habits of “breast-men.”
According to their study, men who displayed breast-preference also contained a larger inclination to smoke – and also quit things – as general endurance was negatively correlated.
I suppose smoking is one of the few habits they’ll choose to endure. Shifting gears, dudes who share a high affinity for smaller breasts, but still favor breasts in general, tend to display a different set of values.
Wiggins et. al suggested a link between petite figures and wealth, as men from upper-class families generally share a taste in smaller physiques.
The authors of this post, at Gene Expression, noted how fashion could play a role in that preference –and I agree.
Small breasts, and small bodies in general, have always been flaunted by models in the high-fashion industry – so this could play a factor in their vision of beauty.
As stated in the study conducted by Wiggins et. al, “preference for the very large buttocks was characterized by a need for order (neatness, organization, orderliness).”
As you can tell, these types of men don’t seem to appreciate “half-assing” things. “Ass-men” also tended to work at business-related jobs, which coincides with their high value of structure in their lives.
The need for large buttocks was also highly related to an overall need for achievement, as well.
While Wiggins seemed to link the love of large asses with order, and neatness, Ali Eaves offers his side of the story.
In a separate study published in Men’s Health, the reason some men are anal about assplay lies within its dirty nature.
According to Eric M. Garrison, a sex expert and author of Mastering Multiple Position Sex, “we're not allowed to go there.
And when it comes to sex, there's something animalistic and dirty about mounting from the rear."
It’s also important to keep in mind your own environmental factors. For instance, where you grow up, personally, also has an effect on what your preference in women will be.
In line with Eaves, 59 percent of men from Argentina favor the ass – while, in Britain, nobody really gives a sh*t about them, no pun intended.
At the end of the day, the choice is in your hands – whichever part of the body you might have a handful of.

Listen to this article 0.5x 1x 1.5x 2x 0:00 / 13:50 You shouldn’t treat her like a ‘10’… Because even the most beautiful girl is only a ‘10’ to a certain chunk of the male population. I came across a fascinating 1968 study on male preferences in female body part sizes this weekend. The study asked men to rate various female silhouettes, like these: Then, at a separate date, in what the male subjects thought was a separate study, the researchers had the same men answer a number of questions about themselves. They then compared the men’s body type preferences to personality attributes and other dimensions to look for correlations. And they discovered (as you might imagine) that different types of men like different types of women. The body type ratings men gave were of figures that looked like this: And the personality dimensions and background details the men provided information on covered the gamut, from social interaction styles to what kind of magazines they read. We’ll talk about the findings of this study and a few other ones, if you’re curious to know what your taste in women says about you. But more than that, the point of this post is going to be to give you one additional tool to help take the girls you really like off any pedestals you have them on... By driving home the point that while you might think she’s a complete 10/10, there are plenty of other men who don’t, and odds are she doesn’t even view herself that way. So You Say She’s a 10? When I was new to cold approach, and I was hanging out on the biggest pickup forum of the time, mASF (that forum’s defunct now, but you can still join ours), at first I’d be really excited when I’d see guys talking about how they were sleeping with these girls who were “10s”. Man, I thought back then, I wonder if I’ll ever get there someday. I viewed these guys as possessing some sort of secret master-type knowledge of women, and probably flawless verbal technique and total understanding of the game. But then I started to see some of these guys post pictures of girls they’d slept with. And my reaction would invariably be, Whoa. THAT girl is not a 10. Not even close! Well, at least she has nice teeth. I wouldn’t say that to them, because I didn’t want to be rude. But my opinion of them would go from, “Titan of Game, sleeping with the world’s most beautiful women,” to, “Dumpster diver who doesn’t even realize he’s a dumpster diver.” I thought these guys were deluding themselves, telling themselves these girls were 10s who were maybe just barely bangable, at best. Yet, I’d go out and try their techniques out on girls I personally found super cute, and I’d discover they worked. And I’d scratch my head and say, It’s crazy. Do they not realize this stuff works on CUTE girls, too? Why are they sticking with those Plain Janes when they can use the same stuff they’re using now and get hotter, higher caliber women? For a while, I figured I just had better fundamentals than these guys did. Maybe these guys just never took time to develop their charisma, I thought. So I was able to use the same stuff they were using and get better results out of it. It took me years, and hanging out with quite a few seducer pals, before I fully learned the biggest reason the girls I got appealed to me so much more and the girls these guys got appealed to me so much less, and it wasn’t because they had crummy fundamentals (every guy I’ve met who gets laid reliably has great fundamentals). The real reason was this: Your 10 isn’t my 10. And my 10 isn’t yours. Alek had a great article about this a few months back. If you haven’t read it, I suggest you check it out now: “Is She Too Hot? Well, Looks are Subjective” In it, we included pictures of six girls, side-by-side, taken from a thread on our forum where guys listed out their dream lays. And in the comment section below the article, readers rated the order of hotness they put each girl in. #5 first, then #2, then #... Etc. And what you saw was multiple different guys who were no slouches with women putting women in completely different places. One guy might think Girl #1 was the hottest girl of them all, and put Girl #4 dead last. But another guy might think Girl #4 was the hottest, and Girl #1 in the middle of the pack. This is important to understand. It’s key to the point of this article. It’s also another reason why I recommend you discard the 1-to-10 looks rating scale. In addition to this scale causing you to psyche yourself out by rating a girl higher value than you see yourself as, it’s also, frankly, just not accurate. That’s because a “10” to you almost certainly is not a “10” to me... And vice versa. And if she isn’t being treated like a “10” by every guy out there, she also isn’t going to have some kind of de facto “10 behavior”... Like many inexperienced men often assume beautiful girls must have. Different Men, Different Preferences That 1968 study, titled “Correlates of Heterosexual Somatic Preference”, as you recall discovered different men prefer different body types differently. Each body part (breasts, butt, legs) had five (5) possible representations in the study: -2 (much smaller) -1 (somewhat smaller) 0 (average) +1 (somewhat larger) +2 (much larger) On average, the ‘standard figure’ – averaged size breasts, buttocks, and legs – received the highest ratings. And on average, the figures where the three body parts – breasts, butt, and legs – were either all larger or all smaller than average received the worst ratings. The only configuration men liked more on average were the +1 breasts (somewhat larger breasts), which men overall liked about slightly more on average than totally standard female body types. Everything else (larger or smaller breasts, butts, or legs) brought men’s ratings down. The biggest minus went to big +2 buttocks. But if you’re a butt man and you’re about to say, “Hey, wait a minute!”, don’t worry – we’ll get to that. Now, as you recall, the researchers also had these men answer various questions about their backgrounds and personalities, and that’s where the real fun begins. That’s because when you set averaging aside and instead looked at who prefers what, the picture grows far more colorful. Here’s what the researchers found on the subject of who likes what: Everything big: men who like breasts, buttocks, and legs all big tend to have a strong need to achieve things. They also tend to drink a lot. Everything standard: men who prefer a completely standard figure (no bigger or smaller than average parts) are the most common group. They are also more likely to be disorganized in their personal habits. Everything small: men who prefer their women’s breasts, buttocks, and legs all small “persevere in their work”, “are not cynical about authority”, and tend to be upper class. Large breasts: men who like girls with big breasts tend to date a lot, have masculine interests, like sports, and browse pornography (this was in 1968, so they found these guys all read Playboy a lot more than the other men in the study). They tend to have more need for sex and like to make witty comments and be the center of attention. They’re independent and not very nurturing, though they do no persevere as much in their work. The men who preferred the largest breast sizes tended to be ones who consumed more pornography (perhaps having their desire for very large breasts shaped by the porn they consume). Small breasts: men who like girls with small breasts drink alcohol less often, and drink less of it when they do drink. They’re more likely to hold fundamentalist religious beliefs, and more likely to be depressed. They’re more nurturing, not cynical of authority, and tend to come from large working class families. They lack in achievement motivation and, at least in college, are indefinite about their career plans. Men who like small-breasted women opt for engineering majors over business majors in school. Large buttocks: men who like big butts have higher need for order (neatness, organization, cleanliness). The men who like the largest buttocks (+2) are more dependent socially, more self-abasing (i.e., they blame themselves for things and feel guilty), and are more emotional, yet are not psychologically minded. In college they tend to be business majors. Small buttocks: the men who liked women with little butts tend to persevere more and do not need to be the center of attention. They usually are not education majors in college, and are not that interested in sports. They’re more likely to have been breast fed as infants. Large legs: men who like large legs on their women are more likely to abstain from alcoholic beverages. Personality-wise, these men are self-abasing, non-aggressive, psychologically minded, and have slow personal tempos. They are inhibited and restrained in social situations. Thin legs: men attracted more to women with small legs, unlike their more restrained large leg loving peers, have strong needs for social participation. They’re nurturing (helpful), affiliative (they like to be involved socially), and exhibitionist (center of attention). They often give up on tasks before they reach completion. Some pretty weird relationships in there, right? I bet you had no idea your butt size preference said so much about you. Of course, there are other dimensions in these ratings as well. For instance, black men are twice as likely as white men to select as most attractive women with larger hip and buttocks sizes, and 1.7x as likely to choose women with thicker thighs. And indeed, if we look at world maps, we can see some clear distinctions in the butts vs. breasts divide (based on searches on PornHub originating from these countries): Europe, Asia, India, Australia, and Argentina (which is almost entirely European descent) have more interest in breasts. Africa, the Middle East, and South and Central America are more interested in butts. The United States, with its diverse ethnic makeup, leans toward butts as well. However, even within the U.S., there are divisions: Compare that map to a map of racial distribution in the United States: ... and you’ll notice the preference for breasts very roughly lines up with English, French, and Germany ancestry, while the preference for butts is (again, very roughly) matched up with African American and Hispanic ancestry. PornHub didn’t have breasts / butt for Alaska and Hawaii, but if I had to guess, Alaska would be boob country (predominantly white folks there). Hawaii might well be too – it’s mostly white and Asian. (also, the United States is a whole lot more German than I realized) Anyway, the point of all this is: While we as men often think that our preferences must translate to every other guy, they don’t. You may see a guy dating a girl with a figure that isn’t your ideal and say to yourself, “Ah, poor schmuck. He needs to step up his game and get a girl with a better ass / better tits,” but she may well have an ideal figure for him... And different size breasts or buttocks might make her less attractive to him instead of more. Faces (as you saw in that article from Alek) are every bit as dramatic, and for various reasons. For instance, as a 1999 study discovered, people tend to prefer opposite sex partners with similar face shapes to their own. You and I are likely to have very different tastes in women if our face shapes are very different from one another’s. You’ll go for girls who look more like you, and I’ll go for girls who look more like me. Your 10 is Not a 10 So is any girl really a ‘10’? I think there are actually two kinds of girls men consider ‘10’s: The made-up 10: this is the girl I talked about not getting taken in by in “You’re Passing Up the Hottest, Coolest Girls.” She’s the one who has to spend two hours on hair, clothes, makeup, and fake eyelashes, then throw on her best pouty aloof face, before she goes out. But when she does, a lot of guys drool all over her and tell their buddies she’s a ‘total 10’. Never mind the fact that when she wakes up the next day she often will look instead like a ‘total 6’. The girl next door 10: this is the ‘genuine’ 10. It doesn’t take her hours to go from 6 to 10. She just rolls out of bed and she’s a 10 to you already. Some combination of her fundamentals and other characteristics makes her striking to you just as she is. The girl next door 10 is the one with more variation between men, because we’re talking about an assessment of her actual physical characteristics. The made-up 10 we’re assessing how good she is at painting her face, taking care of and doing up her hair, preening and posing, and the like, in addition to her ‘base’ (what she looks like underneath the makeup). You’ll find most uninitiated men a lot more inclined to agree a girl is a ‘total 10’ if her neckline plunges low enough to show off her cleavage and her makeup hides all signs of imperfection. But they will still have plenty of disputes about which dressed-to-kill girl is an 8 and which is a 10. The takeaway, either way, must be this: that girl you think is a total babe fought for and desired by everybody... isn’t. Even in social circle, I’ve listened to guys rag on and debate various girls within their circles. You’ve probably seen this. Unless there’s only one hot girl in your social circle, or all your friends have really similar tastes to yours, there’s probably disagreement among you and your friends about which girl in your circle is the hottest. What that means is that even for a girl you consider supremely gorgeous, not every guy is treating her that way. She doesn’t walk around considering herself God’s gift to men (unless she’s a narcissist, of course). Whether she actually is or not under the makeup and poofy hair is anyone’s guess. She’s just a girl. Maybe prettier than ordinary, and if so, she probably knows it. But she probably doesn’t think she is the most beautiful girl. Once you’ve had a few beautiful girlfriends under your belt, you’ll likely have seen this: any of your girlfriends who weren’t narcissists will experience doubt about their looks. They might tell you they know they’re beautiful sometimes, while other times they will tell you they’re not that beautiful or that they wished they were as beautiful as this or that other girl (then sometimes they’ll take it back – “I didn’t really mean it, I just wanted to see how you’d react. I am more beautiful than her!”, but sometimes it’s sincere). You’ll also notice girls care a lot about your taste in women. Former girlfriends, girls who catch your eye, even which girls you think are cute or not in shows and movies. They’re doing that in part to gauge how beautiful they are – if you only go for really beautiful girls, she’s in good company and she must be beautiful. If you go for girls all over the map, that’s a much less ringing endorsement of her beauty. She does this because of the subjective nature of beauty; even the most beautiful girl out there wonders sometimes if she is really beautiful, or if people are just saying it (or maybe the guys she dated weren’t all that picky). Different guys have viewed her looks in different lights, based on their own face shapes, race, class... Even whether they’re restrained or uninhibited socially. So, yeah. No pedestals. She doesn’t see herself as perfect either. Just some girl trying to make her way through life. Focus on good fundamentals, decent game, and make the approach. You’re not up against all the world’s elite men to get her, no matter how hot she is to you. Because there are plenty of men out there who don’t consider her all that hot... No matter who she is. Make the approach, and let things end up where they may. Chase <- Prev Article All Articles Next Article -> Chase Amante Author Chase woke up one day in 2004 tired of being alone.

Thin legs: men attracted more to women with small legs, unlike their more restrained large leg loving peers, have strong needs for social participation. They’re nurturing (helpful), affiliative (they like to be involved socially), and exhibitionist (center of attention). They often give up on tasks before they reach completion.
Some pretty weird relationships in there, right? I bet you had no idea your butt size preference said so much about you.
Of course, there are other dimensions in these ratings as well. For instance, black men are twice as likely as white men to select as most attractive women with larger hip and buttocks sizes, and 1.7x as likely to choose women with thicker thighs. And indeed, if we look at world maps, we can see some clear distinctions in the butts vs. breasts divide (based on searches on PornHub originating from these countries):
Europe, Asia, India, Australia, and Argentina (which is almost entirely European descent) have more interest in breasts. Africa, the Middle East, and South and Central America are more interested in butts. The United States, with its diverse ethnic makeup, leans toward butts as well.
However, even within the U.S., there are divisions:
Compare that map to a map of racial distribution in the United States:
... and you’ll notice the preference for breasts very roughly lines up with English, French, and Germany ancestry, while the preference for butts is (again, very roughly) matched up with African American and Hispanic ancestry.
PornHub didn’t have breasts / butt for Alaska and Hawaii, but if I had to guess, Alaska would be boob country (predominantly white folks there). Hawaii might well be too – it’s mostly white and Asian.
(also, the United States is a whole lot more German than I realized)
While we as men often think that our preferences must translate to every other guy, they don’t.
You may see a guy dating a girl with a figure that isn’t your ideal and say to yourself, “Ah, poor schmuck. He needs to step up his game and get a girl with a better ass / better tits,” but she may well have an ideal figure for him... And different size breasts or buttocks might make her less attractive to him instead of more.
Faces (as you saw in that article from Alek) are every bit as dramatic, and for various reasons. For instance, as a 1999 study discovered, people tend to prefer opposite sex partners with similar face shapes to their own.
You and I are likely to have very different tastes in women if our face shapes are very different from one another’s. You’ll go for girls who look more like you, and I’ll go for girls who look more like me.
I think there are actually two kinds of girls men consider ‘10’s:
The made-up 10: this is the girl I talked about not getting taken in by in “You’re Passing Up the Hottest, Coolest Girls.” She’s the one who has to spend two hours on hair, clothes, makeup, and fake eyelashes, then throw on her best pouty aloof face, before she goes out. But when she does, a lot of guys drool all over her and tell their buddies she’s a ‘total 10’. Never mind the fact that when she wakes up the next day she often will look instead like a ‘total 6’.
The girl next door 10: this is the ‘genuine’ 10. It doesn’t take her hours to go from 6 to 10. She just rolls out of bed and she’s a 10 to you already. Some combination of her fundamentals and other characteristics makes her striking to you just as she is.
The girl next door 10 is the one with more variation between men, because we’re talking about an assessment of her actual physical characteristics. The made-up 10 we’re assessing how good she is at painting her face, taking care of and doing up her hair, preening and posing, and the like, in addition to her ‘base’ (what she looks like underneath the makeup). You’ll find most uninitiated men a lot more inclined to agree a girl is a ‘total 10’ if her neckline plunges low enough to show off her cleavage and her makeup hides all signs of imperfection. But they will still have plenty of disputes about which dressed-to-kill girl is an 8 and which is a 10.
The takeaway, either way, must be this: that girl you think is a total babe fought for and desired by everybody... isn’t.
Even in social circle, I’ve listened to guys rag on and debate various girls within their circles. You’ve probably seen this. Unless there’s only one hot girl in your social circle, or all your friends have really similar tastes to yours, there’s probably disagreement among you and your friends about which girl in your circle is the hottest.
What that means is that even for a girl you consider supremely gorgeous, not every guy is treating her that way. She doesn’t walk around considering herself God’s gift to men (unless she’s a narcissist, of course).
Whether she actually is or not under the makeup and poofy hair is anyone’s guess.
She’s just a girl. Maybe prettier than ordinary, and if so, she probably knows it. But she probably doesn’t think she is the most beautiful girl.
Once you’ve had a few beautiful girlfriends under your belt, you’ll likely have seen this: any of your girlfriends who weren’t narcissists will experience doubt about their looks. They might tell you they know they’re beautiful sometimes, while other times they will tell you they’re not that beautiful or that they wished they were as beautiful as this or that other girl (then sometimes they’ll take it back – “I didn’t really mean it, I just wanted to see how you’d react. I am more beautiful than her!”, but sometimes it’s sincere).
You’ll also notice girls care a lot about your taste in women. Former girlfriends, girls who catch your eye, even which girls you think are cute or not in shows and movies. They’re doing that in part to gauge how beautiful they are – if you only go for really beautiful girls, she’s in good company and she must be beautiful. If you go for girls all over the map, that’s a much less ringing endorsement of her beauty. She does this because of the subjective nature of beauty; even the most beautiful girl out there wonders sometimes if she is really beautiful, or if people are just saying it (or maybe the guys she dated weren’t all that picky).
Different guys have viewed her looks in different lights, based on their own face shapes, race, class... Even whether they’re restrained or uninhibited socially.
So, yeah. No pedestals. She doesn’t see herself as perfect either. Just some girl trying to make her way through life.
Focus on good fundamentals, decent game, and make the approach.
You’re not up against all the world’s elite men to get her, no matter how hot she is to you. Because there are plenty of men out there who don’t consider her all that hot... No matter who she is.
Make the approach, and let things end up where they may.

Post author:Emil O. W. Kirkegaard Post published:7. January 2024 Post category:Evolutionary Psychology / intelligence / IQ / cognitive ability / Sociology George Francis and I have a new exciting study out, the formal and finalized version of George Francis’ 2022 blogpost: Francis, G., & Kirkegaard, E. O. W. (2023). Intelligence and Group Differences in Preference for Breasts over Buttocks. Mankind Quarterly, 64(2), Article 6. https://doi.org/10.46469/mq.2023.64.2.6 Permanent adipose breasts are unique to humans among primates. We propose that permanent breasts, and a preference for them, are an adaptation for pair bonding and a slow life history strategy. This theory predicts that races with a slower life history strategy will prefer breasts to buttocks. To test our hypothesis, we predict preferences for breasts over buttocks from racial admixture and both national and regional average IQ, which we use as an indicator of differences in life history. Measures of Breast-Buttock preference are constructed for nations and subnational regions using the relative frequencies of internet searches on Google, Pornhub and YouPorn for terms related to breasts versus those related to buttocks. Average IQ correlates with Breast-Buttock preference at the national level (r = .76, p < .001), within regions of American countries (r = .85, p < .001), US States (r = .54, p < .001) and US Metro areas (r = .57, p < .001). Controlling for racial ancestry substantially moderated the effect size of intelligence. We consistently found African ancestry to negatively predict breast preference: across countries (r = −.80, p < .001), within US states (r = −.91, p < .001), and US Metro areas (r = −.91, p < .001). These results replicated when using Spanish language search terms within Spanish-speaking countries, suggesting our findings are not peculiar to the English language. Only for US Metro areas did we find a significant effect size for socioeconomic controls. Keywords: Sex, Breasts, Intelligence, Life history, Race, Ethnicity We sought to throw some light on the mystery of human male sexuality preferences for female body features, specifically breasts and butts. Unlike humans, most animals do not have permanently enlarged breasts: Human females are the only primates with permanent adipose breasts. In other primates, the breasts only develop during pregnancy for the purpose of breastfeeding. There have been many theories for the evolution of perennial breasts in humans including thermoregulation, as a fat source akin to a camel’s hump, and as an adaptation to bipedalism (Pawłowski & Żelaźniewicz, 2021). Currently, however, there is no agreed upon explanation for why humans evolved this trait. For a comprehensive review of the literature see Pawłowski and Żelaźniewicz Pawłowski & Żelaźniewicz (2021). Although the origins of human breasts are uncertain, it is clear that they currently play the role of a secondary sexual characteristic, developing through puberty and being arousing to the male members of the species. A particular challenge for any sexual explanation of the evolution of breasts is that the cues created by enlarged breasts may have been unattractive to our ancestors. In other primates, enlarged breasts signal being pregnant, or breast feeding infants and possibly having a male partner. During pregnancy it is near impossible to have another conception (Roellig et al., 2011) and females also face temporary infertility during breast feeding, a phenomenon known as “lactational amenorrhea”. A primate attracted to large breasts not only faces the risk of hostility from another male, but also receives few benefits from any resulting copulation. That breasts have evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, despite possibly signalling sexually unattractive qualities in our ancestors, is a problem we term the “breast paradox”. Pawłowski & Żelaźniewicz (2021, p. 7) refer to this issue as “the key problem” to sexual explanations of the origins of permanent breasts. In essence, evolutionary considerations posit that men should dislike breasts, and yet they like them. And some like them more than others. I have already been involved in some survey research on this topic, which resulted in a study coauthored with the ever-productive Ed Dutton: Gentle-men prefer faces: Intelligence, life history strategy, and sexual preference for attractive faces over attractive breasts, buttocks, and legs: We utilised data from the OkCupid dating site to study preferences for body parts in attraction judgements. We found that most people (71%) have a stated preference for faces, with non-Europeans finding other parts more important: lower parts (“butt/legs”; 8%), chest (“chest/breasts”; 3%), and Other (18%). We regressed these preferences on likely causal variables. We found that slower life history speed, female sex, and higher intelligence predict preference for faces and negatively for buttocks/legs/chest, replicating previous research. We further found that most non-European ethnicities have a stronger preference for buttocks and legs, in particular Africans, Hispanics, and Amerindians (Native Americans). We explored how these patterns may help to explain cultural differences in mating display for different body parts and how they may be explicable in evolutionary terms. In our new study, we sought to examine these relationships at the national and subnational level (e.g. US states) using internet-based data. The key idea here is that men (and some women) who are interested in breasts will search for these on Google or Pornhub (the largest pornography website), and the same is true for men who are interested in butts. While the overall search count may reflect many things — most obviously, the availability of easy internet access and lack of nudity filters — the relative proportion of searches will provide insight into men’s relative preferences for breasts and butts in a given location. Thus, we get metrics such as these: To make sure the data were valid, we first checked whether the Google searches and the Pornhub data correlated well: The correlation turns out to be .91, which is astonishingly good for such data. We still see some odd outliers for Asian countries. For example, in Hong Kong, men are among the most interested in breasts according to Pornhub data, but according to Google searches, they are not much different from Europeans. Looking at the figure, we can also see that poor, mostly African countries tend to be much more interested in butts than breasts. To clarify this relationship, we plotted the data with national intelligence: Aside from the oddity of some of the Asian countries in the Pornhub dataset, there is quite a strong correlation indicating that countries more interested, collectively, in breasts have higher intelligence. We also confirmed the African vs. non-African split in the data. True to stereotypes, Africans were much more interested in butts than breasts relative to other humans. This mirrors our findings from the sex worker survey study (also with George Francis): Sex workers clearly perceive African clients to be more interested in butts. Mind you, these are American sex workers, so they are working with African American men mainly. Our international data thus show that these preferences are consistent across locations. Africans are relatively more interested in butts whether they reside in the USA or in Africa. Thus, this provides another example of the spatial stability of human psychological differences. But one thing is neat plots — what about the regression results? How do the predictors of breast-butt preference fare when they are competing in a model? Here we are using the national data, so with a sample size of up to 193 nations, depending on data availability. Overall, we find that national intelligence and African ancestry (proportion of population’s genetic ancestry, as proxied by international migration data) predict preference for breasts and butts in opposite directions. Southeast Asians also seem to have some residual pro-breast proclivities, perhaps due to Indo-European admixture, in part for India at least. Looking within large countries, we find similar results: Using estimates of regional average intelligence based on various datasets (see the 2016 Admixture in the Americas meta-analysis), we find that intelligence still predicts preference for breasts over butts. In other words, these differences cannot just be due to national cultural differences, as they exist within countries too. We can thus also model the data at the sub-national level, yielding a dataset about equally large to the international one. Here we find the same pattern of results, namely, that intelligence predicts preference for breasts, and African ancestry predicts preference for butts. Interestingly, the overall level of development or wealth of a country didn’t predict anything in the presence of these other variables (S = Socioeconomic factor). Some of the countries used in the above study speak Spanish, not English. So a nice validation of our approach is whether the results still work when we use some of the Spanish terms instead: We find that it does, though not as strongly. This is perhaps because we didn’t use a sufficient amount or the right Spanish terms. I will let the reader know here, that, yes, we did consult experts in Spanish sexual slang. There are not as many Africans or African-admixed peoples in the large Spanish speaking countries, but we still see the African ancestry effect here. Since many people are interested, we also looked at the US subnational data in some detail. First, US states: Indeed, among US states, the less intelligent ones are populated by people who are more interested in butts. However, this pattern is almost entirely due to the African proportions of the states, as there is an amazing correlation of .91 between African (Black) population share and the interest in butts over breasts. However, maybe US states are weird. Many analyses have been done on US states with misleading results due to the “Modifiable areal unit problem” (meaning that state boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and could have been done differently, which might impact results). For this reason, we also explored the metro-level data, that is, data for the largest urban areas: Yet when using metro-level data, we obtain very similar results. In fact, the 208 metros produced almost as strong a correlation between breast-butt preference and African proportion as did the state data, r = .82. One mystery, however, is that among US metro areas, intelligence no longer predicted this preference, while demographics kept predicting it. Also strange was the finding that Asian proportion predicted preference for butts over breasts, opposite of the international data. This suggests some kind of confounding factor, e.g. Asians living in more degenerate or sexually liberated places (choose your own description!) Even the relative amount of development of the metros predicted breast preference. This inconsistency between the international and US metro data is somewhat mysterious. Perhaps one needs to add fixed effects of states, or political ideology (vote shares). Given this pattern of results, we might speculate on the causes: We have found intelligence to be associated with Breast-Buttock preference at the aggregate level. This was consistent with our theory that a preference for breasts is indicative of a slow life history strategy, assuming the average intelligence of human groups is an indicator for life history strategy. The finding was robust to controls for GDP and socioeconomic success. We found a significant effect size for the socioeconomic factor only in the US Metro analysis. Given that this results was only found in this analysis, we suggest economic prosperity is unlikely to cause breast or buttock preference. We suggested that cognitive ability would be correlated with breast preference, but would not cause. Instead, intelligence is likely confounded with life history strategy, which we believe may be causing racial differences in breast preference. Controlling for variables measuring racial ancestry reduced the effect size of intelligence, consistent with our theory. Nevertheless, in many of our analyses cognitive ability still predicted Breast-Buttock preference after controls. This may have been due to the imprecision of our estimates for ancestry making them imperfect controls. Our work leaves open the possibility that intelligence has a causal effect on Breast-Buttock preference. Whether intelligence causes Breast-Buttock preference may be resolved by studying individuals rather than groups. If brighter individuals do not prefer breasts to buttocks more than their less intelligent compatriots from the same ancestry, this would further strengthen our suggestion that intelligence does not cause these preferences. However, if life history theory is valid for individual differences, we might still expect intelligence to be confounded with life history differences within groups. It may also be possible to test whether individual differences in life history causes variation in Breast-Buttock preference. However, it is debated whether life history theory applies meaningfully within groups (Giudice, 2020; of Menie et al., 2021; Zietsch & Sidari, 2020). In other words, intelligence levels may simply be proxying the harder-to-measure differences in life history speed. If this is the case, perhaps we should also see historical changes towards short-term mating interest: If we squint a bit, we can see that the interest in “ass” has eclipsed interest in “breasts” in recent years, insofar as American English books are concerned. Due to the availability of many synonyms for these features, this analysis would require more work. An exciting avenue for future research. Conclusions Using international and subnational comparisons across English and Spanish and two different sources of search interest, we find that Africans are more interested in butts and more intelligent people are more interested in breasts. The African butt interest pattern was found when using international data (many native languages), English inside the USA, and Spanish in Latin American countries. Thus, they are hard to explain away, especially when combined with our prior survey research. The various results don’t really explain the big conundrum of why humans evolved permanently enlarged breasts, though. In fact, it gets more mysterious. For instance, East Asians appear very breast-focused but they have quite small breasts. Somehow evolution did not provide what many Asian men long for (but anime did). It’s hard to see this being the result of some kind of energy constraint, though it is true that Asians are also short, while Asian women prefer taller men. The rise in butt interest in recent decades could be seen as consistent with moral decay, but the timeline doesn’t fit that well, as the big spike in “ass” in American English books dates back only to the 1990s, not to the 1960s cultural revolution. In fact, mentions of “breasts” start increasing around 1975. Why? I don’t know. We might also wonder why the old books from the 1800s had a relatively higher rate of mentioning these topics than modern books pre-1980. Our future research will look into the psychological predictors of interest in various body features and other sexual interests. I’m sure the results will be interesting.

Instead, intelligence is likely confounded with life history strategy, which we believe may be causing racial differences in breast preference. Controlling for variables measuring racial ancestry reduced the effect size of intelligence, consistent with our theory.

This may have been due to the imprecision of our estimates for ancestry making them imperfect controls. Our work leaves open the possibility that intelligence has a causal effect on Breast-Buttock preference.
Whether intelligence causes Breast-Buttock preference may be resolved by studying individuals rather than groups. If brighter individuals do not prefer breasts to buttocks more than their less intelligent compatriots from the same ancestry, this would further strengthen our suggestion that intelligence does not cause these preferences. However, if life history theory is valid for individual differences, we might still expect intelligence to be confounded with life history differences within groups. It may also be possible to test whether individual differences in life history causes variation in Breast-Buttock preference. However, it is debated whether life history theory applies meaningfully within groups (Giudice, 2020; of Menie et al., 2021; Zietsch & Sidari, 2020).
In other words, intelligence levels may simply be proxying the harder-to-measure differences in life history speed. If this is the case, perhaps we should also see historical changes towards short-term mating interest:
If we squint a bit, we can see that the interest in “ass” has eclipsed interest in “breasts” in recent years, insofar as American English books are concerned. Due to the availability of many synonyms for these features, this analysis would require more work. An exciting avenue for future research.
Using international and subnational comparisons across English and Spanish and two different sources of search interest, we find that Africans are more interested in butts and more intelligent people are more interested in breasts. The African butt interest pattern was found when using international data (many native languages), English inside the USA, and Spanish in Latin American countries. Thus, they are hard to explain away, especially when combined with our prior survey research.
The various results don’t really explain the big conundrum of why humans evolved permanently enlarged breasts, though. In fact, it gets more mysterious. For instance, East Asians appear very breast-focused but they have quite small breasts. Somehow evolution did not provide what many Asian men long for (but anime did). It’s hard to see this being the result of some kind of energy constraint, though it is true that Asians are also short, while Asian women prefer taller men.
The rise in butt interest in recent decades could be seen as consistent with moral decay, but the timeline doesn’t fit that well, as the big spike in “ass” in American English books dates back only to the 1990s, not to the 1960s cultural revolution. In fact, mentions of “breasts” start increasing around 1975. Why? I don’t know. We might also wonder why the old books from the 1800s had a relatively higher rate of mentioning these topics than modern books pre-1980.
Our future research will look into the psychological predictors of interest in various body features and other sexual interests. I’m sure the results will be interesting.

Something I find much more interested than the distribution of preferences themselves:
The strong instinct for people across the spectrum to evangelize about their preference! Skinny girl guys can't STAND that there are men on the internet who actually prefer a BMI in the 24-28 range and must visciously shame them and enforce what they see as the norm and vice versa.
Why the hell would anyone WANT every body to be attracted to the same things as them and compete with them for it? It makes no sense to me.
It looks like guys on the left were a lot more likely to prefer genitals, and men on the right to prefer feet. Which is odd.
Is there even such thing as a female with a foot fetish or is that an entirely male thing? Very hard to imagine any women liking male feet. My husband literally has the ugliest giant ogre feet I've ever seen, so thankfully I don't care about such things!
Also did you ask about age? Bc I feel like older guys would be more into boobs since pre-2000s everything was about big boobs and small butts, and that kind of reversed the past 20 years. Most playmates and models in the 90s and before had flat asses.

Post author:Emil O. W. Kirkegaard Post published:7. January 2024 Post category:Evolutionary Psychology / intelligence / IQ / cognitive ability / Sociology George Francis and I have a new exciting study out, the formal and finalized version of George Francis’ 2022 blogpost: Francis, G., & Kirkegaard, E. O. W. (2023). Intelligence and Group Differences in Preference for Breasts over Buttocks. Mankind Quarterly, 64(2), Article 6. https://doi.org/10.46469/mq.2023.64.2.6 Permanent adipose breasts are unique to humans among primates. We propose that permanent breasts, and a preference for them, are an adaptation for pair bonding and a slow life history strategy. This theory predicts that races with a slower life history strategy will prefer breasts to buttocks. To test our hypothesis, we predict preferences for breasts over buttocks from racial admixture and both national and regional average IQ, which we use as an indicator of differences in life history. Measures of Breast-Buttock preference are constructed for nations and subnational regions using the relative frequencies of internet searches on Google, Pornhub and YouPorn for terms related to breasts versus those related to buttocks. Average IQ correlates with Breast-Buttock preference at the national level (r = .76, p < .001), within regions of American countries (r = .85, p < .001), US States (r = .54, p < .001) and US Metro areas (r = .57, p < .001). Controlling for racial ancestry substantially moderated the effect size of intelligence. We consistently found African ancestry to negatively predict breast preference: across countries (r = −.80, p < .001), within US states (r = −.91, p < .001), and US Metro areas (r = −.91, p < .001). These results replicated when using Spanish language search terms within Spanish-speaking countries, suggesting our findings are not peculiar to the English language. Only for US Metro areas did we find a significant effect size for socioeconomic controls. Keywords: Sex, Breasts, Intelligence, Life history, Race, Ethnicity We sought to throw some light on the mystery of human male sexuality preferences for female body features, specifically breasts and butts. Unlike humans, most animals do not have permanently enlarged breasts: Human females are the only primates with permanent adipose breasts. In other primates, the breasts only develop during pregnancy for the purpose of breastfeeding. There have been many theories for the evolution of perennial breasts in humans including thermoregulation, as a fat source akin to a camel’s hump, and as an adaptation to bipedalism (Pawłowski & Żelaźniewicz, 2021). Currently, however, there is no agreed upon explanation for why humans evolved this trait. For a comprehensive review of the literature see Pawłowski and Żelaźniewicz Pawłowski & Żelaźniewicz (2021). Although the origins of human breasts are uncertain, it is clear that they currently play the role of a secondary sexual characteristic, developing through puberty and being arousing to the male members of the species. A particular challenge for any sexual explanation of the evolution of breasts is that the cues created by enlarged breasts may have been unattractive to our ancestors. In other primates, enlarged breasts signal being pregnant, or breast feeding infants and possibly having a male partner. During pregnancy it is near impossible to have another conception (Roellig et al., 2011) and females also face temporary infertility during breast feeding, a phenomenon known as “lactational amenorrhea”. A primate attracted to large breasts not only faces the risk of hostility from another male, but also receives few benefits from any resulting copulation. That breasts have evolved as a secondary sexual characteristic, despite possibly signalling sexually unattractive qualities in our ancestors, is a problem we term the “breast paradox”. Pawłowski & Żelaźniewicz (2021, p. 7) refer to this issue as “the key problem” to sexual explanations of the origins of permanent breasts. In essence, evolutionary considerations posit that men should dislike breasts, and yet they like them. And some like them more than others. I have already been involved in some survey research on this topic, which resulted in a study coauthored with the ever-productive Ed Dutton: Gentle-men prefer faces: Intelligence, life history strategy, and sexual preference for attractive faces over attractive breasts, buttocks, and legs: We utilised data from the OkCupid dating site to study preferences for body parts in attraction judgements. We found that most people (71%) have a stated preference for faces, with non-Europeans finding other parts more important: lower parts (“butt/legs”; 8%), chest (“chest/breasts”; 3%), and Other (18%). We regressed these preferences on likely causal variables. We found that slower life history speed, female sex, and higher intelligence predict preference for faces and negatively for buttocks/legs/chest, replicating previous research. We further found that most non-European ethnicities have a stronger preference for buttocks and legs, in particular Africans, Hispanics, and Amerindians (Native Americans). We explored how these patterns may help to explain cultural differences in mating display for different body parts and how they may be explicable in evolutionary terms. In our new study, we sought to examine these relationships at the national and subnational level (e.g. US states) using internet-based data. The key idea here is that men (and some women) who are interested in breasts will search for these on Google or Pornhub (the largest pornography website), and the same is true for men who are interested in butts. While the overall search count may reflect many things — most obviously, the availability of easy internet access and lack of nudity filters — the relative proportion of searches will provide insight into men’s relative preferences for breasts and butts in a given location. Thus, we get metrics such as these: To make sure the data were valid, we first checked whether the Google searches and the Pornhub data correlated well: The correlation turns out to be .91, which is astonishingly good for such data. We still see some odd outliers for Asian countries. For example, in Hong Kong, men are among the most interested in breasts according to Pornhub data, but according to Google searches, they are not much different from Europeans. Looking at the figure, we can also see that poor, mostly African countries tend to be much more interested in butts than breasts. To clarify this relationship, we plotted the data with national intelligence: Aside from the oddity of some of the Asian countries in the Pornhub dataset, there is quite a strong correlation indicating that countries more interested, collectively, in breasts have higher intelligence. We also confirmed the African vs. non-African split in the data. True to stereotypes, Africans were much more interested in butts than breasts relative to other humans. This mirrors our findings from the sex worker survey study (also with George Francis): Sex workers clearly perceive African clients to be more interested in butts. Mind you, these are American sex workers, so they are working with African American men mainly. Our international data thus show that these preferences are consistent across locations. Africans are relatively more interested in butts whether they reside in the USA or in Africa. Thus, this provides another example of the spatial stability of human psychological differences. But one thing is neat plots — what about the regression results? How do the predictors of breast-butt preference fare when they are competing in a model? Here we are using the national data, so with a sample size of up to 193 nations, depending on data availability. Overall, we find that national intelligence and African ancestry (proportion of population’s genetic ancestry, as proxied by international migration data) predict preference for breasts and butts in opposite directions. Southeast Asians also seem to have some residual pro-breast proclivities, perhaps due to Indo-European admixture, in part for India at least. Looking within large countries, we find similar results: Using estimates of regional average intelligence based on various datasets (see the 2016 Admixture in the Americas meta-analysis), we find that intelligence still predicts preference for breasts over butts. In other words, these differences cannot just be due to national cultural differences, as they exist within countries too. We can thus also model the data at the sub-national level, yielding a dataset about equally large to the international one. Here we find the same pattern of results, namely, that intelligence predicts preference for breasts, and African ancestry predicts preference for butts. Interestingly, the overall level of development or wealth of a country didn’t predict anything in the presence of these other variables (S = Socioeconomic factor). Some of the countries used in the above study speak Spanish, not English. So a nice validation of our approach is whether the results still work when we use some of the Spanish terms instead: We find that it does, though not as strongly. This is perhaps because we didn’t use a sufficient amount or the right Spanish terms. I will let the reader know here, that, yes, we did consult experts in Spanish sexual slang. There are not as many Africans or African-admixed peoples in the large Spanish speaking countries, but we still see the African ancestry effect here. Since many people are interested, we also looked at the US subnational data in some detail. First, US states: Indeed, among US states, the less intelligent ones are populated by people who are more interested in butts. However, this pattern is almost entirely due to the African proportions of the states, as there is an amazing correlation of .91 between African (Black) population share and the interest in butts over breasts. However, maybe US states are weird. Many analyses have been done on US states with misleading results due to the “Modifiable areal unit problem” (meaning that state boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and could have been done differently, which might impact results). For this reason, we also explored the metro-level data, that is, data for the largest urban areas: Yet when using metro-level data, we obtain very similar results. In fact, the 208 metros produced almost as strong a correlation between breast-butt preference and African proportion as did the state data, r = .82. One mystery, however, is that among US metro areas, intelligence no longer predicted this preference, while demographics kept predicting it. Also strange was the finding that Asian proportion predicted preference for butts over breasts, opposite of the international data. This suggests some kind of confounding factor, e.g. Asians living in more degenerate or sexually liberated places (choose your own description!) Even the relative amount of development of the metros predicted breast preference. This inconsistency between the international and US metro data is somewhat mysterious. Perhaps one needs to add fixed effects of states, or political ideology (vote shares). Given this pattern of results, we might speculate on the causes: We have found intelligence to be associated with Breast-Buttock preference at the aggregate level. This was consistent with our theory that a preference for breasts is indicative of a slow life history strategy, assuming the average intelligence of human groups is an indicator for life history strategy. The finding was robust to controls for GDP and socioeconomic success. We found a significant effect size for the socioeconomic factor only in the US Metro analysis. Given that this results was only found in this analysis, we suggest economic prosperity is unlikely to cause breast or buttock preference. We suggested that cognitive ability would be correlated with breast preference, but would not cause. Instead, intelligence is likely confounded with life history strategy, which we believe may be causing racial differences in breast preference. Controlling for variables measuring racial ancestry reduced the effect size of intelligence, consistent with our theory. Nevertheless, in many of our analyses cognitive ability still predicted Breast-Buttock preference after controls. This may have been due to the imprecision of our estimates for ancestry making them imperfect controls. Our work leaves open the possibility that intelligence has a causal effect on Breast-Buttock preference. Whether intelligence causes Breast-Buttock preference may be resolved by studying individuals rather than groups. If brighter individuals do not prefer breasts to buttocks more than their less intelligent compatriots from the same ancestry, this would further strengthen our suggestion that intelligence does not cause these preferences. However, if life history theory is valid for individual differences, we might still expect intelligence to be confounded with life history differences within groups. It may also be possible to test whether individual differences in life history causes variation in Breast-Buttock preference. However, it is debated whether life history theory applies meaningfully within groups (Giudice, 2020; of Menie et al., 2021; Zietsch & Sidari, 2020). In other words, intelligence levels may simply be proxying the harder-to-measure differences in life history speed.

Even the relative amount of development of the metros predicted breast preference. This inconsistency between the international and US metro data is somewhat mysterious. Perhaps one needs to add fixed effects of states, or political ideology (vote shares).
Given this pattern of results, we might speculate on the causes:
We have found intelligence to be associated with Breast-Buttock preference at the aggregate level. This was consistent with our theory that a preference for breasts is indicative of a slow life history strategy, assuming the average intelligence of human groups is an indicator for life history strategy. The finding was robust to controls for GDP and socioeconomic success. We found a significant effect size for the socioeconomic factor only in the US Metro analysis. Given that this results was only found in this analysis, we suggest economic prosperity is unlikely to cause breast or buttock preference.
We suggested that cognitive ability would be correlated with breast preference, but would not cause. Instead, intelligence is likely confounded with life history strategy, which we believe may be causing racial differences in breast preference. Controlling for variables measuring racial ancestry reduced the effect size of intelligence, consistent with our theory. Nevertheless, in many of our analyses cognitive ability still predicted Breast-Buttock preference after controls. This may have been due to the imprecision of our estimates for ancestry making them imperfect controls. Our work leaves open the possibility that intelligence has a causal effect on Breast-Buttock preference.
Whether intelligence causes Breast-Buttock preference may be resolved by studying individuals rather than groups. If brighter individuals do not prefer breasts to buttocks more than their less intelligent compatriots from the same ancestry, this would further strengthen our suggestion that intelligence does not cause these preferences. However, if life history theory is valid for individual differences, we might still expect intelligence to be confounded with life history differences within groups. It may also be possible to test whether individual differences in life history causes variation in Breast-Buttock preference. However, it is debated whether life history theory applies meaningfully within groups (Giudice, 2020; of Menie et al., 2021; Zietsch & Sidari, 2020).
In other words, intelligence levels may simply be proxying the harder-to-measure differences in life history speed. If this is the case, perhaps we should also see historical changes towards short-term mating interest:
If we squint a bit, we can see that the interest in “ass” has eclipsed interest in “breasts” in recent years, insofar as American English books are concerned. Due to the availability of many synonyms for these features, this analysis would require more work. An exciting avenue for future research.
Using international and subnational comparisons across English and Spanish and two different sources of search interest, we find that Africans are more interested in butts and more intelligent people are more interested in breasts. The African butt interest pattern was found when using international data (many native languages), English inside the USA, and Spanish in Latin American countries. Thus, they are hard to explain away, especially when combined with our prior survey research.
The various results don’t really explain the big conundrum of why humans evolved permanently enlarged breasts, though. In fact, it gets more mysterious. For instance, East Asians appear very breast-focused but they have quite small breasts. Somehow evolution did not provide what many Asian men long for (but anime did). It’s hard to see this being the result of some kind of energy constraint, though it is true that Asians are also short, while Asian women prefer taller men.
The rise in butt interest in recent decades could be seen as consistent with moral decay, but the timeline doesn’t fit that well, as the big spike in “ass” in American English books dates back only to the 1990s, not to the 1960s cultural revolution. In fact, mentions of “breasts” start increasing around 1975. Why? I don’t know. We might also wonder why the old books from the 1800s had a relatively higher rate of mentioning these topics than modern books pre-1980.
Our future research will look into the psychological predictors of interest in various body features and other sexual interests. I’m sure the results will be interesting.

Something I find much more interested than the distribution of preferences themselves:
The strong instinct for people across the spectrum to evangelize about their preference! Skinny girl guys can't STAND that there are men on the internet who actually prefer a BMI in the 24-28 range and must visciously shame them and enforce what they see as the norm and vice versa.
Why the hell would anyone WANT every body to be attracted to the same things as them and compete with them for it? It makes no sense to me.
It looks like guys on the left were a lot more likely to prefer genitals, and men on the right to prefer feet. Which is odd.
Is there even such thing as a female with a foot fetish or is that an entirely male thing? Very hard to imagine any women liking male feet. My husband literally has the ugliest giant ogre feet I've ever seen, so thankfully I don't care about such things!
Also did you ask about age? Bc I feel like older guys would be more into boobs since pre-2000s everything was about big boobs and small butts, and that kind of reversed the past 20 years. Most playmates and models in the 90s and before had flat asses.
