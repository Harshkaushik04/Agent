Not gonna lie, I'll be super disappointed if this loses to Death Stranding 2
Best Game Direction (I feel like Death Stranding 2 will get it)
Best Narrative (It has a chance here but Death Stranding 2 may also take it)
Best Art Direction (I don’t know if anything else could viably beat it right now)
Best Score and Music (no way it loses this one)
Best Audio Design (might get this but again it’s iffy)
Best Performance - guessing it’d be for Jennifer English or Ben Starr (Death Stranding 2 will probably win this)
Best Independent Game (this HAS to win that)
Best Role Playing Game (This is an absolute lock)

Expedition 33 or death stranding 2: which game wins?
Expedition 33 vs Death Stranding 2 | Which Game Will Win Gamers’ Hearts?
A growing discussion among gamers is heating up as they weigh the merits of Expedition 33 against Death Stranding 2. Players express a desire for a game they can immerse themselves in for weeks.
The Heart of the Matter: What’s Being Said?
With both titles generating buzz, opinions vary widely online. One user mentioned, "I just want a masterpiece I can enjoy for the next few weeks." This sentiment echoes through several comments, revealing a yearning for engaging gameplay.
Initial Reactions are Favoring Expedition 33
Many comments lean toward Expedition 33, highlighting its affordability and fresh appeal as a new IP. One commenter recommended, "I say buy Expedition 33 first. It’s only $50 and has an amazing story."
Notable points from the discussion include:
Replayability: Enthusiasts praise Expedition 33 for its better replay factor, suggesting various challenge runs.
Pricing: At $50, it undercuts the $70 price tag of Death Stranding 2, appealing to cost-conscious gamers.
Story Engagement: The lack of previous game experience doesn't hinder enjoyment. As one user noted, "You don’t need to have played the first installment to love Expedition 33."
Contrasting Perspectives on Death Stranding 2
On the flip side, some gamers caution against diving straight into Death Stranding 2 without experiencing the first title. A user commented, "I really cannot recommend DS2 if you haven't played the first game," emphasizing the risk of confusion regarding the storyline.
🌟 Expedition 33 is praised for its engaging story and price.
💬 "You can’t enjoy Death Stranding 2 fully without context from the first game."
🔄 Death Stranding 2 is seen as offering low replay value post-completion.
As of now, Expedition 33 seems to command the attention of players looking for a rich gaming experience, while Death Stranding 2's appeal may be limited to those already familiar with its narrative. With strong sentiments backing both titles, the battle for the best gaming experience continues. 🕹️
As the gaming community continues to buzz about Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2, it's likely we'll see a split in player engagement. There's a strong chance that Expedition 33 will capture the hearts of casual gamers looking for affordable fun, with experts estimating around a 60% preference for it in upcoming forums. Conversely, die-hard fans of the original Death Stranding might rally to support its sequel, resulting in a 40% interest in Death Stranding 2 among dedicated players who value narrative depth. The competition could heat up during sales events, and community feedback may drive further promotions or updates from developers, keeping both titles in the limelight as favorites in gamers' choices.
Echoes from the Past: A Lesson in Gaming Rivalry
This situation reminds us of the competition between classic shooters, Doom and Quake, in the late '90s. While Doom offered thrilling single-player experiences that appealed to casual fans, Quake forged ahead with its multiplayer focus, attracting competitive gaming enthusiasts. Much like today’s debate, players had to choose their loyalty based on style and experience preferences. This historical competition enriched the overall gaming scene, creating lasting legacies for both titles. Likewise, Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2 could forge their paths, contributing to a dynamic gaming landscape shaped by player tastes and experiences.

Sign in to your TheGamer account I skipped Death Stranding 2: On the Beach this year because I wisely decided that, if I spent 50 hours finally playing the first Death Stranding, I would absolutely not be in the mood for another 50-hour hike. Sometimes the timing isn’t right and you just have to let the zeitgeist pass you by. Which is why I feel really stupid about still not having rolled credits on Hollow Knight a full month after Silksong came out. To paraphrase DJ Khaled, I played myself. Silksong hype was so intense that I tricked myself into believing that the two weeks of heads-up Team Cherry provided was enough to get through its dense, difficult predecessor. Now the Silksong train has left the station and I'm left looking for a ticket to the next one.

Sign in to your Game Rant account Perhaps the only anticipation comparable to the release of Hollow Knight: Silksong is the upcoming release of GTA 6, with the former being completely surrounded by hype in the short lead-up to its release. Many fans no doubt remember the Silksong clown memes that cropped up with every release, but those days are now behind them. However, there's still a serious question of how Hollow Knight: Silksong holds up to that anticipation. As such, the best answer may not be critic reviews, even if most reviews of Hollow Knight: Silksong are glowing. It's user scores. While user scores have been used in the past to misguide Metacritic readers via review bombing campaigns, most games are not influenced by this controversy. With that in mind, it seems there are five games released in 2025 that have landed with their audience more than Hollow Knight: Silksong. Based on user scores, that is namely Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Digimon Story: Time Stranger, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter, and Donkey Kong Bananza. It's worth noting that both Clair Obscur and Donkey Kong: Bananza released much sooner than Silksong, but user scores do not end at a review embargo. Both Clair Obscur and Donkey Kong are still receiving reviews as of October 15. This, if anything, makes the ultimate user scores a little more reliable, as it reflects the ongoing fan temperature around these titles. Of course, it's a close game, with Hollow Knight: Silksong's 9.0/10 user score nothing to scoff at. As it stands, Clair Obscur holds a strong presence among gamers at a 9.6. Digimon Story reviews follow with a 9.2, while Sonic Racing, Trails in the Sky, and Donkey Kong have 9.1s. Silksong User Score Reviews competition Hollow Knight: Silksong User Reviews Vs.

Looking at these user scores, it's interesting to see how everything shakes out. Clair Obscur and Hollow Knight are the only indie games of the bunch, both of which will also likely take home several awards at The Game Awards 2025. Many consider Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 a shoo-in for Game of the Year award, and that's certainly reasonable. However, several other popular GOTY contenders are not on this list.

The Game of the Year category at the Game Awards is typically a highly competitive field. Even when there are clear frontrunners, the competition can have some unexpected twists and turns to deliver big wins to unsuspecting winners. However, this year has taken a turn, with Clair Obscura: Expedition 33 barreling ahead in early projections to become the clear favorite for most categories, but especially Game of the Year. Videos by ComicBook.com This was only cemented further by recent developments, such as the Sandfall Interactive-developed title earning 12 award nominations at the Game Awards and cleaning up at the Golden Joystick Awards. The game has picked up so much momentum, in fact, that one of the developers seen as the most competitive rival for the top award doesn’t even seem to think they need to show up. Here’s why Clair Obscura has become such a lock for the Game of the Year Award, and the chances of another nominee upsetting it. Why Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Developers Don’t Think They’ll Win Game Of The Year Although Hollow Knight: Silksong is in the running for Game of the Year at this year’s Game Awards, it seems that the team behind it doesn’t think they’re going to actually walk away with the award. During an interview with Bloomberg, Team Cherry developers William Pellen and Ari Gibson discussed the game’s reception and their chances at the Game Awards. While it’s clear the team is honored by the nominations that Silksong has received, Gibson believes the game is “On that knife’s edge, where it appeals to some and infuriates others.” This is reflective of the game’s overall reception among critics and the broader gaming audience. While Silksong received high marks for its design, gameplay, and core mechanics, the title has also attracted plenty of complaints from players who feel the side-scrolling Metroid-vania game is just too difficult. As a result, the pair of developers isn’t clearing the schedule to attend the Game Awards this year, reasoning they’re plenty busy and that they expect another game to take home the Game of the Year award. “This year I think we’re safe. I think Expedition 33 — it’s exceptional and broadly palatable,” Gibson explained. This blunt assessment of the state of the race speaks to just how much of a favorite that Clair Obscura: Expedition 33 has become for the big award. Expedition 33 Has All The Makings Of An Award Season Frontrunner Dominating the gaming conversation all year since it launched in April, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has all the makings of an award season favorite. The game’s art design and narrative appeal to the critics who appreciate the artistry behind games, while the tight modern refinement of the classic RPG gameplay makes the game a clear winner in the eyes of hardcore gamers. The cinematic qualities of the game lend a certain prestigious element to the experience, while the stand-alone original nature of the game gives it a natural edge over the various sequels and franchise titles that otherwise dominate the nominations for the top award. The game was even produced by an independent developer, Sandfall Interactive, which is a genuine boon in an era where criticism against the larger gaming conglomerates has become more open. It’s popular with gamers, selling over 5 million copies within six months, all while being available for players who have Xbox Game Pass. It’s also been doing well at precursor awards, earning major wins at the TIGA Awards, Japan Games Awards, and Golden Joystick Awards. In pretty much every important precursor field, Expedition 33 has been a dominant force, to the point where Vegas odds have the game as the faraway favorite to take the Game of the Year award with a 90% chance of taking home the top award. What Are The Chances Any Other Game Will Unseat Expedition 33 For Game Of The Year? At this point, it’s looking incredibly unlikely that any game could upset Clair Obscura. The best chance the game has is that the voting base, confident enough in the victory from other sources, goes for more unorthodox picks. However, following Clair Obscura‘s record-breaking number of nominations and domination at the Golden Joystick Awards, those chances seem to be an outlier at best. Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong are currently projected to be the closest in contention for the top award, but even Silksong‘s developers don’t seem to have any expectations of upsetting the award. Hades 2 has been incredibly well-received, but Silksong stole much of the thunder from that title due to their similar nature as deceptively difficult and gorgeously animated games. Donkey Kong Bananza‘s lack of nominations in other categories suggests that it won’t make much of a splash at the event. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2‘s devoted fan base and a timely sale for the complete game might make it a spoiler for the fan portion of the vote, but Clair Obscura seems to have pulled so far ahead that even full support from fans won’t be enough to counteract the momentum that Clair Obscura has gained. At this point, even other developers can see the writing on the wall, suggesting that Clair Obscura has a very good night to look forward to on December 11.

However, following Clair Obscura‘s record-breaking number of nominations and domination at the Golden Joystick Awards, those chances seem to be an outlier at best.
Hideo Kojima’s Death Stranding 2 and Hollow Knight: Silksong are currently projected to be the closest in contention for the top award, but even Silksong‘s developers don’t seem to have any expectations of upsetting the award. Hades 2 has been incredibly well-received, but Silksong stole much of the thunder from that title due to their similar nature as deceptively difficult and gorgeously animated games.
Donkey Kong Bananza‘s lack of nominations in other categories suggests that it won’t make much of a splash at the event. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2‘s devoted fan base and a timely sale for the complete game might make it a spoiler for the fan portion of the vote, but Clair Obscura seems to have pulled so far ahead that even full support from fans won’t be enough to counteract the momentum that Clair Obscura has gained. At this point, even other developers can see the writing on the wall, suggesting that Clair Obscura has a very good night to look forward to on December 11.

Not gonna lie, I'll be super disappointed if this loses to Death Stranding 2
Best Game Direction (I feel like Death Stranding 2 will get it)
Best Narrative (It has a chance here but Death Stranding 2 may also take it)
Best Art Direction (I don’t know if anything else could viably beat it right now)
Best Score and Music (no way it loses this one)
Best Audio Design (might get this but again it’s iffy)
Best Performance - guessing it’d be for Jennifer English or Ben Starr (Death Stranding 2 will probably win this)
Best Independent Game (this HAS to win that)
Best Role Playing Game (This is an absolute lock)

Expedition 33 or death stranding 2: which game wins?
Expedition 33 vs Death Stranding 2 | Which Game Will Win Gamers’ Hearts?
A growing discussion among gamers is heating up as they weigh the merits of Expedition 33 against Death Stranding 2. Players express a desire for a game they can immerse themselves in for weeks.
The Heart of the Matter: What’s Being Said?
With both titles generating buzz, opinions vary widely online. One user mentioned, "I just want a masterpiece I can enjoy for the next few weeks." This sentiment echoes through several comments, revealing a yearning for engaging gameplay.
Initial Reactions are Favoring Expedition 33
Many comments lean toward Expedition 33, highlighting its affordability and fresh appeal as a new IP. One commenter recommended, "I say buy Expedition 33 first. It’s only $50 and has an amazing story."
Notable points from the discussion include:
Replayability: Enthusiasts praise Expedition 33 for its better replay factor, suggesting various challenge runs.
Pricing: At $50, it undercuts the $70 price tag of Death Stranding 2, appealing to cost-conscious gamers.
Story Engagement: The lack of previous game experience doesn't hinder enjoyment. As one user noted, "You don’t need to have played the first installment to love Expedition 33."
Contrasting Perspectives on Death Stranding 2
On the flip side, some gamers caution against diving straight into Death Stranding 2 without experiencing the first title. A user commented, "I really cannot recommend DS2 if you haven't played the first game," emphasizing the risk of confusion regarding the storyline.
🌟 Expedition 33 is praised for its engaging story and price.
💬 "You can’t enjoy Death Stranding 2 fully without context from the first game."
🔄 Death Stranding 2 is seen as offering low replay value post-completion.
As of now, Expedition 33 seems to command the attention of players looking for a rich gaming experience, while Death Stranding 2's appeal may be limited to those already familiar with its narrative. With strong sentiments backing both titles, the battle for the best gaming experience continues. 🕹️
As the gaming community continues to buzz about Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2, it's likely we'll see a split in player engagement. There's a strong chance that Expedition 33 will capture the hearts of casual gamers looking for affordable fun, with experts estimating around a 60% preference for it in upcoming forums. Conversely, die-hard fans of the original Death Stranding might rally to support its sequel, resulting in a 40% interest in Death Stranding 2 among dedicated players who value narrative depth. The competition could heat up during sales events, and community feedback may drive further promotions or updates from developers, keeping both titles in the limelight as favorites in gamers' choices.
Echoes from the Past: A Lesson in Gaming Rivalry
This situation reminds us of the competition between classic shooters, Doom and Quake, in the late '90s. While Doom offered thrilling single-player experiences that appealed to casual fans, Quake forged ahead with its multiplayer focus, attracting competitive gaming enthusiasts. Much like today’s debate, players had to choose their loyalty based on style and experience preferences. This historical competition enriched the overall gaming scene, creating lasting legacies for both titles. Likewise, Expedition 33 and Death Stranding 2 could forge their paths, contributing to a dynamic gaming landscape shaped by player tastes and experiences.

Death Stranding 2 vs Clair Obscur Expedition 33: Who’s the frontrunner for GOTY 2025?
The 2025 edition of The Game Awards is scheduled for December 11, 2025. The year 2025 has been a goldmine of game releases, but two titles have truly stood out, thanks to their critical acclaim and overwhelming support from fans. These are Death Stranding 2 On the Beach by Kojima Productions and Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur Expedition 33.
However, questions have been raised about which of the two could lead the race for the highly anticipated GOTY 2025 title. In this article, we explore both Death Stranding 2 and Clair Obscur Expedition 33 to see which one stands as the stronger contender for this year’s Game Awards.
Death Stranding 2 surpasses Expedition 33 as the highest-rated game on the PlayStation Store
Death Stranding 2 has quickly earned its place at the top of the PlayStation Store, boasting a 4.93 user score, which is only just ahead of Clair Obscur’s 4.91. With 97% of its ratings being a perfect five stars, it’s clear that Kojima’s sequel is being favored by fans.

Unlike its predecessor, which received a more mixed response, Death Stranding 2 is being praised for smoothing out everything that already worked well before. With smoother traversal, improved pacing, emotional storytelling, and stunning visuals, the sequel feels like a more refined and focused experience overall.
However, the sequel doesn’t dramatically reinvent the formula. It builds upon the original’s systems, adding some new elements like environmental hazards and a wider range of tools, but it still feels like the classic Death Stranding. This is both its strength and its potential weakness.
Clair Obscur is still the favorite in many eyes
Clair Obscur Expedition 33 took everyone by surprise earlier in 2025. A brand-new IP from indie studio Sandfall Interactive, it blends turn-based combat with real-time mechanics in a way that feels fresh and exciting.
The game didn’t just earn praise; it also shattered records. With a 93 critic score on Metacritic and an astonishing 9.7 user score based on over 17,000 reviews, it has instantly become a fan favorite. In comparison, Death Stranding 2 holds a 90 critic score and an 8.9 user score.
What makes Expedition 33 special isn’t just the gameplay – it’s the art direction, storytelling, soundtrack, and the fact that it dared to bring innovation back to turn-based RPGs. In a market that often plays it safe, Clair Obscur is bold, risky, and wildly creative. It offers something genuinely new, and that could be the deciding factor come awards season.
This year’s GOTY showdown could come down to one core difference, which is innovation versus refinement. Death Stranding 2 is polished – it looks, feels, and sounds incredible. But it’s not a massive leap from the first game.
On the other hand, Expedition 33 comes as a breath of fresh air in the turn-based adventure genre that many may have forgotten.
That difference matters. The Game Awards often favors risk-takers. Past winners like It Takes Two, Disco Elysium, and Breath of the Wild were praised for breaking new ground. If history is any indication, Clair Obscur’s boldness might give it the edge.
Upcoming games that could also be strong contenders
Since 2025 isn't over, many upcoming games could also be possible nominees for GOTY 2025. With The Outer Worlds 2, Ghost of Yotei, Donkey Kong Bananza, and even Hollow Knight Silksong set to drop later this year, the field could still shift dramatically.
Games like Split Fiction, The Alters, Kingdom Come Deliverance II, and several other 2025 releases may also prove to be strong contenders for a GOTY nomination.
Still, at this point, in 2025, the spotlight is squarely on Death Stranding 2 and Clair Obscur Expedition 33, two wildly different games representing different gameplay styles.
Death Stranding 2 delivers a cinematic, emotional, and technically outstanding experience that improves on nearly every aspect of its predecessor. Clair Obscur Expedition 33, however, brings bold new ideas, genre-defying combat, and a unique artistic vision to the table.
All things considered, while Death Stranding 2 delivers a near-perfect experience, Expedition 33 stands out with its originality and bold innovation. It might just be the stronger contender between the two, but with The Game Awards, anything can happen.
With five months remaining in 2025 and a few heavy hitters still waiting in line, the 2025 GOTY race is anything but settled. The battle between Death Stranding 2 and Clair Obscur might be one of the most compelling face-offs the industry has seen in years.
