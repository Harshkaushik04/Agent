Zoom level changed to 1 Population distribution by gender is a crucial demographic metric that shapes the social, economic, and cultural fabric of nations. Male and female population ratios vary widely across the globe, driven by factors such as birth rates, life expectancy, migration, and cultural practices. In some countries, particularly those with higher birth rates and lower life expectancy for men, females tend to outnumber males. On the other hand, in countries with large male immigrant populations, males significantly outnumber females. Understanding the gender balance of a country is vital for planning social services, healthcare, employment strategies, and policies related to gender equality. The male-female ratio influences workforce composition, family structures, and population growth. In this article, we will explore the population distribution of males and females in various countries, highlighting the most significant differences. Top 10 Countries by Male and Female Population ChartBar chart with 2 data series.The chart has 1 X axis displaying categories. The chart has 1 Y axis displaying values. Data ranges from 66167291 to 748323427.End of interactive chart. In this bar chart, we see some of the world’s largest populations, where the gender balance varies significantly. India and China, the two most populous countries, show a notable gender imbalance, with more males than females. This is partly due to cultural preferences for male children and varying life expectancies. In contrast, countries like Russia and Brazil have more females than males, influenced by factors like higher male mortality rates and the impacts of historical events such as wars. Countries like the United States and Indonesia display a relatively balanced gender ratio, with only slight differences between male and female populations. The presence of more males in certain countries, like Pakistan and Nigeria, is often due to higher birth rates and lower female life expectancy. Meanwhile, Brazil and Russia stand out as countries with more females, a trend driven by higher male mortality rates, especially in Russia due to health issues and lifestyle factors.

For example, in Saudi Arabia and the UAE, a large number of male migrant workers contribute to a skewed gender ratio. Similarly, India and China have long had cultural and demographic reasons for higher male populations. In the United States and Indonesia, the difference is relatively small, showing a more balanced gender distribution compared to other countries on the list.

In Russia, the significant difference is due to high male mortality rates from health issues and lifestyle factors. In Japan, Brazil, and Mexico, the higher female population is linked to longer female life expectancy. Countries like Ukraine and Vietnam show similar trends due to historical events that have disproportionately impacted the male population.

The median age in the World is 30.9 years (2025).
A Total Fertility Rate (TFR) of 2.1 represents the Replacement-Level Fertility: the average number of children per woman needed for each generation to exactly replace itself without needing international immigration. A value below 2.1 will cause the native population to decline

Currently, 58% of the population of the World is urban (4,774,646,303 people in 2025)
The 2025 population density in the World is 55 people per Km2 (143 people per mi2), calculated on a total land area of 148,940,000 Km2 (57,506,032 sq. miles).

A Population pyramid (also called "Age-Sex Pyramid") is a graphical representation of the age and sex of a population.
Expansive - pyramid with a wide base (larger percentage of people in younger age groups, indicating high birth rates and high fertility rates) and narrow top (high death rate and lower life expectancies). It suggests a growing population. Example: Nigeria Population Pyramid
Constrictive - pyramid with a narrow base (lower percentage of younger people, indicating declining birth rates with each succeeding age group getting smaller than the previous one). Example: United States
Stationary - with a somewhat equal proportion of the population in each age group. The population is stable, neither increasing nor decreasing.
There are three types of age dependency ratio: Youth, Elderly, and Total. All three ratios are commonly multiplied by 100.
Definition: population ages 0-15 divided by the population ages 16-64.
Formula: ([Population ages 0-15] ÷ [Population ages 16-64]) × 100
Definition: population ages 65-plus divided by the population ages 16-64.
Formula: ([Population ages 65-plus] ÷ [Population ages 16-64]) × 100
Definition: sum of the youth and old-age ratios.
Formula: (([Population ages 0-15] + [Population ages 65-plus]) ÷ [Population ages 16-64]) × 100
NOTE: Dependency Ratio does not take into account labor force participation rates by age group. Some portion of the population counted as "working age" may actually be unemployed or not in the labor force whereas some portion of the "dependent" population may be employed and not necessarily economically dependent.

Population annual doubling time, years: The number of years required for the total population to double in size if the annual rate of population change would remain constant. It is calculated as ln(2)/r where r is the annual population growth rate. Doubling time is computed only for fast growing populations with growth rates exceeding 0.5 per cent. Population aged 0-14, percent: Proportion of the population between age 0 and age 14. Population aged 10-19, percent: Proportion of the population between age 10 and age 19. Population aged 10-24, percent: Proportion of the population between age 10 and age 24. Population aged 15-64, percent: Proportion of the population between age 15 and age 64. Population aged 65 and older, percent: Proportion of the population aged 65 and older. Total fertility rate: Number of children who would be born per woman if she lived to the end of her childbearing years and bore children at each age in accordance with prevailing age-specific fertility rates. Life expectancy at birth: Number of years newborn children would live if subject to the mortality risks prevailing for the cross section of population at the time of their birth.
