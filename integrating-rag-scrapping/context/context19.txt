I have consulted the dictionary but I can not get a clear response. What does: "Eh bien" mean in this context?
-On va au cinéma demain, Julie ? -Demain, c'est quel jour ? Vendredi ? -Oui, c'est ça. Le premier octobre. -Non, je ne peux pas. Nous allons à la piscine, les enfants et moi. -C'est dommage.
-Eh bien, tu sais, nager c'est bon pour la santé. Et les enfants adorent ça.
Eh bien peut ou bien exprimer une opposition ou bien une conséquence vis-à-vis de la phrase précédente. il faudrait donner un peu plus de contexte, au moins la phrase précédente. P. O. – P. O. 2016-09-16 12:23:08 +00:00 Commented Sep 16, 2016 at 12:23

1 You can translate it to 'Well, you know, swimming is healthy' Weedoze – Weedoze 2016-09-16 12:45:37 +00:00 Commented Sep 16, 2016 at 12:45
"Eh Bien" here is used to show empathy. Julie knows that she has to spend time at the pool with her children and can't go to the movies. She also knows that it disappoints the person she talks to (C'est dommage).
Though, the sentence could keep its meaning without "Eh Bien". It shows Julie cares for the person she talks to.
In english I would use the word "well". But "Eh bien" is totally idiomatic, and I don't think there's a synonym in French for this.
Well, you know, swimming is good for the health.
"Eh Bien" can have several other meanings too depending on the context. Top three cases i would use it for are :
"Eh bien, ce cuisinier est vraiment doué", "Woah, this cook is talented"
"Eh bien, tu es pas pressé", "Damn, you're not in a hurry"

I have usually seen this phase used in the context of "Oh Well". Sort of a word resignation to the condition or outcome. Based on my various French Language study.
Additionally, in modern familiar, mostly spoken French, you can also encounter "Eh ben". Replacement can be "Dis donc". https://fr.wiktionary.org/wiki/dis_donc (mostly oral though), e.g.:
Dis donc, tu parles français comme si c'était ta langue maternelle !
