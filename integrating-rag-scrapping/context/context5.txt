The Economic Times daily newspaper is available online now.
Bharti Singh defends Samay Raina amid controversy: 'GenZ loves him, you'll become his fan too!'
India's Got Latent faces controversy after a remark by YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia led to criticism and legal action. Host Samay Raina also faced backlash but received support from celebrities like Bharti Singh. Allahbadia apologized for his comments. Despite criticism, Raina's humour remains popular with certain audiences and the show retains a significant viewership.
Samay Raina finds support in comedian Bharti Singh amid the Ranveer Allahbadia controversy. The controversy surrounding India’s Got Latent has intensified after YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia’s inappropriate remark on the show led to widespread criticism. His question, deemed offensive by many, resulted in legal action, with a complaint filed against him for promoting obscenity. As the debate raged on, comedian Samay Raina, the host of the show, also faced backlash. However, several celebrities, including Rakhi Sawant, Aly Goni, and Munawar Faruqui, have come forward in his defence. Among the latest to support Raina is comedian Bharti Singh, who recently appeared as a guest on the show alongside her husband, Haarsh Limbachiyaa, and singer Tony Kakkar.Addressing the controversy, Bharti Singh defended Raina, emphasizing that India’s Got Latent has a distinct style of humour that appeals to its audience. She stated that viewers have the choice to engage with the content or ignore it, rather than dictating how the show should be run. She described Raina as a talented and well-liked figure among Gen Z audiences, adding that his humour resonates with a particular demographic.Regarding the use of explicit language on the show, Bharti acknowledged that while some may find it offensive, millions of viewers still watch and enjoy the content. She suggested that those who dislike Raina’s style of comedy should simply opt-out rather than criticize his approachMeanwhile, Ranveer Allahbadia’s controversial remark about “parents” led to an official enquiry after the Mumbai Police Commissioner and the National Commission for Women received the complaint. Eventually, an FIR was registered against Allahbadia and others involved in the show. Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis also weighed in on the matter, condemning the remarks.In response to the backlash, Allahbadia released a video apologizing for his comments, acknowledging that his attempt at humour was misplaced. He admitted that the joke was in poor taste and recognized that comedy might not be his forte. Despite his apology, criticism continued to mount, leading to further scrutiny of India’s Got Latent, particularly regarding the explicit language often used on the show.Add as a Reliable and Trusted News Source Add Now!

My take on Harkirat Singh(4 cr engineer guy on youtube), would love to hear your opinion.
Preface: I haven't watched all his videos only 2-3. Those gave me a very strong gut feeling about this guy.
Freshers, take what he says with a giant grain of salt and think for yourself.
Crypto bro landed a remote job with some probably pump and dump crypto project or some NFT shit. Now he's using the "4 cr" tag to farm attention from freshers and JEE guys who don't know any better. His cohort is just selling shovels in a gold rush.Also he is very misleading, example: in one video this guy says that college doesn't matter with placement these days. And on-campus placements are also suffering, and that he heard from somewhere that only two companies visited IITD for internships.So, I agree that the job market is rough right now, but how can a guy from an IIT claim that only two companies visit IITD for internships (He should know better, I can say this because I am also from one). I will sacrifice my left nut if only two companies visit IITD for internships. This is clearly to mislead freshers and JEE guys who aren't in the know yet, probably to sell them his cohort. I don't think anyone 3rd year + or anyone with industry experience would find this guy credible.
Video link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dl3w_VMTZU
I am really interested to hear your take on this. Don't hold back and also feel free to correct me if I am wrong somewhere in my assessment.

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please contact the moderators of this subreddit if you have any questions or concerns.
Software developers who are financially stable don't rely on YouTube for money
I've never seen his videos but just looking at the playlist I see,
Frequency of uploads indicate he's using YouTube as a full time job
He might be an "entrepreneur", if you know what I mean :)
Passionpreneur. Read it in Dev Gadhvi's voice. 😂
Aditya kachwe (Chatgpt ka dalal) enters the chat.
Yeah, you'll never catch genuine guys like Harisam Sharma selling courses or flaunting his package for attention."Entrepreneur" spreading like covid these days.
Yeah imagine earning 4cr from your job and still having so much time to make YouTube videos, courses
Remember college name matters. You have better opportunity with college name. He landed a job at goldman because of his college. I am from tier one and amount of opportunity I get to interview are 100x more than any 3rd degree college. It has been a cake walk for me. I did less hard work nd still draw more salary just because of college name. Background. So don't get fooled.
Edit : I think this is somewhat misleading. I did a lot of hard work to get to the tier 1 college and so does everyone in tier 1 apart from reservation. So yes we did hardwork at the right time. So even tier 3 can get to any level but you have to compensate for that.
Agreed. I'm in the same boat. The company I have lined up doesn't even hire off campus so idk how he could claim something so stupid. Only explanation is he is deliberately lying.
No, it is possible but why to make your path hard..
Someone trying to milk their tag almost every video is a pretty big red flag.
I remember when he launched the first cohort, he said, "I will be just doing this once, and I have charged a fee so only serious people attend the cohort. After that I will continue my new job" 🤡
Bro just promotes MERN stack like crazy. "Learn MERN stack, there are plenty of opportunities available"
Like bro have you ever opened linkedin ?? Heck even remote job platforms are crowded like crazy
He has developed his identity in that way that in starting you think he is definitely not selling courses after sometime you will understand he is also same as others who claim that this course will change your trajectory and what not
Will start ;_; i am a fresher in a job and people in cohort are very legit with 6,18 varying level of experience
I even bought his cohort.. Let's connect in the DMs
All these ' FAANG Influencers' are nothing but are course sellers.
Remember be a follower not a fan always question everything
If some one is selling u how to make money they are the actual ones making money out from u by luring in the trap
Only choose his cohort if you think that is going to help u learn the things u want and not portraying that 4 cr job trap
I think if you are aware of industry workings and programming languages most of fresher are dont then you should definitely go to the college to get the core fundamentals and about harkirat yes he uses his 4 crore tag every where in his videos or in his interviews he is just a guy who got lucky in the covid boom everyone know salaries were all time high at that time so he is using advantage of that.
It's a common trend from these dipshit post college youtubers. They get somewhat popular by probably making decent genuine content, then some companies offer them sponsorship and they throw it all under the bus for a few lakhs. Another example is that BITS Goa guy who threw his own alma mater under the bus lying his teeth out just so he could promote more scalar courses.
I haven't watched his videos but regarding the college take -
I think for initial opportunity college matters but nowadays many tier 3 freshers are also landing good jobs by doing dsa etc (so college importance is definitely less than old days)
Also for experienced people skills matter not college.
True but somehow he found the most misleading way of saying that.
These guys have made the deal with devil, sold their soul. And now they are selling courses to students. No passion for engineering.

Bharti Singh supports Samay Raina amid controversy: He's a good and talented guy
Comedian Bharti Singh supported Samay Raina amid the India's Got Latent controversy. The comedian praised Samay and said that he is very sweet, and anyone can become his fan once they get to meet him.
Comedian Bharti Singh backed Samay Raina after Ranveer Allahbadia made an inappropriate remark on his show India’s Got Latent, sparking backlash. Amid the ongoing outrage, Bharti extended her support to Samay and said how he is not what he is being portrayed.
Bharti Singh, who was a guest on the show with her husband, Harsh Limbachiyaa, and singer Tony Kakkar, described Samay as a talented person.
When a paparazzo asked about her point of view on the ongoing controversy, the Laughter Chefs’ star said, “Woh show hi aisa hai, but zaroori nahi ki aap show mein jaake wahi bolo jo show ki requirement hai. Aapki marzi—bolo ya na bolo. Samay thodi kehta hai, ‘Arey, muh kholo, bolo!’ Samay bohot accha ladka hai aur talented bhi hai. Gen-Z ka pasand hai woh. Khud jaoge toh uske fan ho jaoge. Itna accha hai (That’s the nature of the show, but it’s not necessary to say something just because the format demands it. It’s your choice—say it or don’t. Samay doesn’t force anyone by saying, 'Come on, speak up!' He’s a really good guy and very talented. Gen-Z loves him. If you meet him in person, you’ll become his fan—he’s that great).”
A post shared by Manas Bollywood (@manasbollywood)
She further commented on the nasty language used on the show and said, “Agar uski language jo use karta hai woh pasand nahi hai, toh millions hai aur hum hi hai, jo Samay Raina lagate hai aur dekhte hain (If you don’t like the language he uses, there are millions of others to watch. But we are the ones who choose to watch Samay Raina).”
Ranveer, known to many by his YouTube channel's name, BeerBiceps, appeared as a panelist on Samay Raina's India’s Got Latent alongside content creators Ashish Chanchlani and Apoorva Makhija aka The Rebel Kid. However, as snippets from the controversial episode surfaced online, viewers criticised certain jokes as obscene. In one particular clip, Ranveer is seen asking a contestant a question that landed him in hot water.
He asked, "Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once to make it stop forever?" The joke did not sit well with the internet or the authorities, which consequently resulted in multiple police complaints being filed against the content creator.
The YouTuber later apologised for his remarks and all the videos of the episodes have been removed from YouTube.

Ranveer Allahabadia found himself in a major controversy due to his remarks on comedian Samay Raina's YouTube show India's Got Latent.
Multiple complaints have been filed in Mumbai against Ranveer, Samay, and Apoorva Mukhija who were on the show's panel, over the use of abusive language.
Samay Raina, who has a degree in print engineering, discovered his true passion in stand-up comedy. He is best known for his unhinged, often ‘dark’ comedy style, which can sometimes make people uncomfortable.
During the pandemic, Samay built a huge subscriber base on YouTube by hosting and streaming chess games. His unique combination of skillful gameplay and humor quickly won over fans, making his streams highly popular.
Samay Raina has gained massive popularity, with 7.36 million subscribers on his YouTube channel and six million followers on Instagram, making him one of the leading stand-up comedians in India today.
Samay Raina was born in Jammu, in the region of Jammu and Kashmir, into a conservative Kashmiri Pandit family. He initially enrolled in a print engineering course at PVG's COET in Pune, Maharashtra, which he later described as a waste of time. Instead, he began participating in open mic events and eventually became a regular in the local comedy scene.
Samay Raina is the founder of YouTube show India’s Got Latent, a comedic twist on the well-known India’s Got Talent. In his show, contestants from across the country take the stage to show off their talents—or sometimes their lack of it. After their performances, the judges, including Samay and his guest panelists, put them through a humorous and critical questioning session.
Multiple police cases have been filed against Samay Raina, Ranveer Allahbadia, and others due to controversial comments made on Samay’s YouTube show India’s Got Latent. The show has faced massive backlash, with accusations of promoting obscenity and engaging in sexually explicit and vulgar discussions.
During his appearance on India’s Got Latent, social media influencer Ranveer Allahbadia asked a highly inappropriate question to a contestant, which sparked a huge uproar. He asked, "Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever."
As a result, multiple police complaints were filed against him. Bombay High Court advocates Ashish Ray and Pankaj Mishra have since written to Mumbai Police Commissioner Vivek Phalsankar and the state women's commission, stating that the remarks made on the show disrespected women and must lead to action.
