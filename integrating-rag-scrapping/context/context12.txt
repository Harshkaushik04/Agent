In Safed, too, the [Sabbatai] movement gathered strength during the autumn of 1665. The reports about the utter destruction, in 1662 [sic], of the Jewish settlement there seem greatly exaggerated, and the conclusions based on them are false. ... Rosanes' account of the destruction of the Safed community is based on a misunderstanding of his sources; the community declined in numbers but continued to exist ... A very lively account of the Jewish community is given by French trader d'Arvieux who visited Safed in 1660.

Archived from the original on November 20, 2008. Retrieved April 16, 2007. Fewer Israeli civilians died in Palestinian attacks in 2006 than in any year since the Palestinian uprising began in 2000. Palestinian militants killed 23 Israelis and foreign visitors in 2006, down from a high of 289 in 2002 during the height of the uprising. Most significant, successful suicide bombings in Israel nearly came to a halt. Last year, only two Palestinian suicide bombers managed to sneak into Israel for attacks that killed 11 people and wounded 30 others. Israel has gone nearly nine months without a suicide bombing inside its borders, the longest period without such an attack since 2000[...] An Israeli military spokeswoman said one major factor in that success had been Israel's controversial separation barrier, a still-growing 250-mile (400 km) network of concrete walls, high-tech fencing and other obstacles that cuts through parts of the West Bank. 'The security fence was put up to stop terror, and that's what it's doing,' said Capt. Noa Meir, a spokeswoman for the Israel Defense Forces. [...] Opponents of the wall grudgingly acknowledge that it's been effective in stopping bombers, though they complain that its route should have followed the border between Israel and the Palestinian territories known as the Green Line. [...] IDF spokeswoman Meir said Israeli military operations that disrupted militants planning attacks from the West Bank also deserved credit for the drop in Israeli fatalities.

Origin and history of the conflict between Israel and Palestine by World History Edu · February 29, 2024 The conflict between Israel and Palestine is a complex and multifaceted issue that has its roots in both ancient history and more recent political developments. It encompasses territorial disputes, religious significance of the land to both Jews and Muslims, nationalist aspirations, and international political dynamics. In the article below, WHE historians cover the origin and history of the Israel-Palestine conflict, tracing its development from ancient times to the present day.nextstay Ancient and Medieval History The land known today as Israel and Palestine has been inhabited since prehistoric times. In antiquity, it was known as Canaan and later, particularly by the Jews, as the Land of Israel. Jewish kingdoms existed in the region several millennia ago, including the united monarchy of Israel and Judah in the 10th century BCE and their subsequent divided kingdoms. These early Jewish states were conquered by a succession of imperial powers, including the Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans. The Roman conquest and the Jewish revolts against Roman rule (66-70 CE and 132-136 CE) led to the widespread dispersion of the Jewish people, a diaspora that lasted nearly two millennia. Throughout the medieval period, the region was controlled by various Islamic caliphates and later by the Ottoman Empire from 1517 until the early 20th century. During these centuries, the land was predominantly populated by Arab Muslims, but it also included Christians, Jews, and other groups, each maintaining their religious and cultural practices. The Zionist Movement and British Mandate The modern phase of the conflict began in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the rise of Zionism among European Jews. Zionism emerged as a nationalist movement aiming to establish a Jewish homeland in Palestine in response to widespread anti-Semitism and persecution in Europe. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, supported the establishment of a “national home for the Jewish people” in Palestine, which was then part of the Ottoman Empire and under British control following World War I. The British Mandate for Palestine (1920-1948) saw increased immigration of Jews fleeing persecution in Europe, particularly during the Nazi era, which led to rising tensions between Jewish and Arab communities. The Arabs opposed the growing Jewish presence and the idea of a Jewish state, leading to outbreaks of violence. Partition and the Establishment of Israel The United Nations proposed a partition plan in 1947 to solve the conflict, dividing the land into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem as an international city. The Jewish leadership accepted the plan, but the Arab leaders rejected it, leading to the outbreak of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War following the declaration of the State of Israel on May 14, 1948. The 1948 war ended with Israel expanding its territory beyond the UN-proposed borders and the creation of a large number of Palestinian refugees. No Palestinian state was established, and the West Bank and Gaza Strip were occupied by Jordan and Egypt, respectively. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is deeply rooted in history, involving a complex interplay of religious, nationalistic, and geopolitical factors. Efforts to achieve a lasting peace have faced numerous challenges, including deep-seated mistrust, political instability, and external influences. Wars and Peace Efforts The decades following 1948 saw several wars between Israel and its Arab neighbors (1956, 1967, 1973), as well as ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestinians. The Six-Day War in 1967 was particularly significant, as Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and other territories, bringing them under military occupation. Efforts to resolve the conflict have included peace treaties between Israel and Egypt (1979) and Israel and Jordan (1994), as well as various attempts to negotiate a peace between Israelis and Palestinians. The Oslo Accords (1993) marked a significant though ultimately unsuccessful attempt to establish a framework for peace, including the creation of the Palestinian Authority and limited self-governance in certain areas of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The Current Situation The current state of the Israel-Palestine conflict is characterized by ongoing disputes over land, the status of Jerusalem, the rights of Palestinian refugees, and security concerns. The peace process has been stalled for many years, with sporadic outbreaks of violence and efforts at reconciliation. Israel’s settlements in the West Bank, deemed illegal under international law but disputed by Israel, and the blockade of the Gaza Strip, controlled by the Islamist movement Hamas since 2007, have been major points of contention. The international community remains divided on how to resolve the conflict, with proposals ranging from a two-state solution, which envisions an independent State of Palestine alongside Israel, to various forms of one-state solutions that would encompass both populations. Frequently asked questions about the Israel-Palestine conflict The Israel-Palestine conflict raises many questions due to its complexity and long history. Below are some frequently asked questions (FAQs) about the conflict, providing concise answers to each. What are the main causes of the Israel-Palestine conflict? The main causes include territorial disputes, national identity, the establishment of a Jewish state in a region predominantly Arab by the early 20th century, historical claims to the land, and the displacement of Palestinian Arabs. What is Zionism? Zionism is a nationalist movement that emerged in the late 19th century among Jews in Europe, advocating for the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in the territory defined as the historic Land of Israel (Palestine). It arose in response to anti-Semitism and persecution in Europe. What are the 1967 borders? The 1967 borders, often referred to in peace negotiations, are based on the armistice lines established after the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. These borders changed following the Six-Day War in 1967 when Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem, and other territories. These pre-1967 lines are frequently cited as a basis for negotiating a two-state solution. What is the two-state solution? The two-state solution proposes resolving the conflict by establishing two sovereign states: Israel as the state for the Jewish people and Palestine as the state for the Palestinian people, with borders, generally based on those existing before the 1967 war, but with mutually agreed land swaps. What are settlements? Settlements are communities established by Israel within the West Bank (including East Jerusalem) and, until 2005, the Gaza Strip. The international community generally considers these settlements illegal under international law, a view that Israel disputes. Settlements are a major source of contention in the conflict. Who are the Palestinians? Palestinians are the Arab people whose families lived in the area that is now Israel and the Palestinian territories (West Bank and Gaza Strip) before the creation of the state of Israel and/or who identify as part of the Palestinian people. Today, Palestinians live in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Israel, and in refugee camps in neighboring Arab countries. Image: The Palestinian flag What role has the United Nations played in the conflict? The United Nations has played a significant role in the conflict since partitioning the British Mandate for Palestine into a Jewish and an Arab state in 1947, a plan accepted by Jews but rejected by Arabs. The UN has since been involved in peacekeeping and mediation efforts, and its agencies provide assistance to Palestinian refugees. What is the significance of Jerusalem in the conflict? Jerusalem holds profound religious significance for Jews, Muslims, and Christians. The city was divided between Israel and Jordan from 1948 until 1967, when Israel took control of East Jerusalem. Israel considers the entire city its capital, while Palestinians see East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state. The status of Jerusalem remains one of the most contentious issues in the conflict. What is the Gaza blockade? The Gaza blockade is a land, air, and sea blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt on the Gaza Strip since 2007, after Hamas took control of the area. Israel states the blockade is necessary to limit Hamas’s ability to arm itself, while critics argue it amounts to collective punishment of Gaza’s civilian population. Has there been any progress towards peace? There have been several attempts at peace, including the Oslo Accords (1993) and the Camp David Summit (2000), but lasting peace remains elusive. Factors such as political changes, violence, settlement expansion, and disagreements over key issues like borders, refugees, and the status of Jerusalem have hindered progress.

In the 17 centuries BC, following the call of God, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob settled in Canaan, later known as the Land of Israel. In 1000 BC, King Saul established the Israelite monarchy, which was later split into the Kingdom of Israel and the Kingdom of Judah. The conquest of Roman Empire in 63 BC gave the name “Palestine” to Judah. During this time, Christianity became a dominant religion towards the end of the Roman Empire. In 636 came an Arab conquest, beginning the spread of Islam. In the 11th century, Christians in Europe launched several crusades to bring the Holy City back to the hand of the Christians while from the 16th century, more and more Jews were joining a movement called Zionism aiming to create a Jewish national state in its ancient homeland. WWI exploded in 1918 and ended with the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. Its land in the Middle East was carved by the British and French Empires. The region under the control of Britain was what it called the British mandate for Palestine. Tensions between the Jews and the Arabs who both claimed the land grew, which even led to acts of violence. In 1947, the UN partitioned Palestine into two independent states: a Jewish state and an Arab state with the City of Jerusalem becoming an international zone with a special status. Less than one year after that, Israel declared itself an independent state. Right after the declaration, the 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out and ended when a cease-fire agreement was reached in 1949, giving more than two-thirds of historic Palestine, including West Jerusalem, to Israel. There came more wars and fighting in the following decades, namely the Six-Day War ending with the victory of Israel, the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon kicking the Palestinian Liberation Organization out of Beirut, the First Intifada ending with the Oslo Accords, the Second Intifada ending with Israel’s withdrawal from Gaza. Then came the establishment of Hamas, a Sunni Islamist militant group founded in 1987, aiming to destroy the state of Israel and create an Islamic state. After the Battle of Gaza (a conflict between Hamas and Fatah), Hamas split from the Palestinian authority and gained power in the Gaza while the West Bank was separately controlled by the PLO.Israel put Gaza under a suffocating blockade, leading to several bloody wars between Israel and Hamas, the military group in control of the Gaza Strip till today.What caused wars between Israel and Palestine?

Timeline from Conflict & Warfare and Contemporary History Israeli-Palestinian Conflict Timeline Explore the history and important events behind the long-standing Middle East conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians from 1947 to today. Last Updated June 24, 2025 Smoke rises in Gaza following Israeli strikes on October 9, 2023. Source: Mohammed Salem / Reuters The conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians reflects a long-standing struggle in the region encompassing the land between the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. That conflict has deep historical roots, shaped by statehood claims from the Israelis and the Palestinians that have been supported by various international agendas and activities over time. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back more than a century, with flashpoints building from the United Nations’ 1947 initial UN Partition Plan to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, to the recent Israel-Hamas war sparked in October 2023.Despite continued efforts at brokering peace—including the 1978 Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, and the 2020 Abraham Accords—conflict has persisted.This timeline explores some of the pivotal moments in the conflict from 1947 to today. TIMELINE Launch Timeline Start Timeline Nov 29, 1947 Jews celebrate the Partition Plan in Jerusalem on November 29, 1947. Universal History Archive UN Partition Plan The UN General Assembly passes Resolution 181 calling for the partition of the Palestinian territories into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The resolution also envisions an international, UN-run body to administer Jerusalem. The Palestinian territories had been under the military and administrative control of the United Kingdom (known as a mandate) since the 1917 defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Civil strife and violence between the Jewish and Arab communities of the Palestinian territories intensifies. May 14, 1948 David Ben-Gurion, flanked by the members of his provisional government, reads the declaration of independence in the Tel Aviv Museum Hall. Saar Yaacov/Israel GPO Israel Declares Independence Israel declares its independence as the British rule ends. Sparked by Israel’s declaration of independence, the first Arab-Israeli War begins. Egypt (supported by Saudi Arabian, Sudanese, and Yemeni troops), Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria invade Israel. The fighting continues until 1949, when Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria sign armistice agreements. Dec 11, 1948 Palestinian women and children hike toward Arab-controlled territory in the West Bank on June 26, 1948. Bettmann / Getty Images UN Addresses Palestinian Displacement Over the course of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, at least seven hundred thousand Palestinian refugees flee their homes in an exodus known to Palestinians as the nakba (Arabic for “catastrophe”). Israel wins the war, retaining the territory provided to it by the United Nations and capturing some of the areas designated for the imagined future Palestinian state. Israel gains control of West Jerusalem, Egypt gains the Gaza Strip, and Jordan gains the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including the Old City and its historic Jewish quarter. In 1948, the UN General Assembly passes Resolution 194, which calls for the repatriation of Palestinian refugees. The Palestinians will later point to Resolution 194 as having established a “right of return” for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. The specific parameters of that return are debated in the decades that follow, including among many descendants from the 1948 refugees and the three hundred thousand Palestinians who will flee their homes during the June 1967 war. Jun 5, 1967 - Jun 10, 1967 An Israeli gun boat passes through the Straits of Tiran during the Six-Day War. Israel GPO. The Six-Day War Israel and several of its Arab neighbors fight the Six-Day War. Israel wins a decisive victory: it suffers seven hundred casualties; its adversaries suffer nearly twenty thousand. Israel emerges with control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip—areas inhabited primarily by Palestinians—as well as all of East Jerusalem. Israel also takes control of Syria’s Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula, which is part of Egypt. Israel will stay in the Sinai Peninsula until April 1982. Nov 22, 1967 The UN Security Council meet in 1967. Yutaka Nagata / United Nations UN Security Council Resolution Calls for Israeli Withdrawal The UN Security Council passes Resolution 242 calling for Israeli “withdrawal … from territories occupied in the recent conflict” and for the termination of “states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of every state in the area and the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.” The resolution establishes the concept of land for peace. Oct 3, 1973 Egyptian forces cross the Suez Canal in 1973. CIA The Yom Kippur War Another Arab-Israeli war, known variously as the Yom Kippur War, the Ramadan War, and the October War, is fought when Egypt and Syria attempt to retake the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. Cold War tensions spike as the Soviet Union aids Egypt and Syria and the United States aids Israel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries begins an oil embargo on countries that support Israel, and the price of oil skyrockets. The fighting ends after a UN-sponsored ceasefire (negotiated by the United States and the Soviet Union) takes hold. The UN Security Council passes Resolution 338, which calls for implementing UN Security Council Resolution 242.

François Lochon / Getty Images Israel Withdraws From the Sinai Peninsula Egypt and Israel sign a peace treaty, the first between Israel and one of its Arab neighbors. The treaty commits Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula and evacuate its settlements there. The termination of the state of war between Egypt and Israel leads to the normalization of diplomatic and commercial relations between the two countries. Israel’s prime minister and Egypt’s president exchange letters reaffirming their commitment—outlined in the Camp David Accords—to negotiate the disposition of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.

Jim Hollander / Reuters First Intifada An Israeli driver kills four Palestinians in a car accident that sparks the first intifada, or uprising, against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. The image of Palestinians throwing rocks at Israeli tanks becomes the enduring image of the intifada. Over the next six years, roughly 200 Israelis and 1,300 Palestinians are killed. A Palestinian cleric named Sheikh Ahmed Yassin establishes the militant group Hamas as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood.

Ali Jareki / Reuters Jordan Surrenders Claims on the West Bank and East Jerusalem King Hussein of Jordan relinquishes his country’s claims to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in favor of the claims of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In December of the same year, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat denounces violence, recognizes Israel’s right to exist, and acknowledges UN Security Council Resolution 242 and the concept of land for peace. The United States responds to Arafat’s announcement by beginning direct talks with him, though it suspends the talks following a Palestinian terrorist attack against Israel.

Israeli, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian delegates attend the first negotiations among those parties. The talks proceed along bilateral tracks between Israel and its neighbors, though the Lebanese join the Syrian delegation and the Jordanian team includes Palestinian representatives. A multilateral track includes the wider Arab world and addresses regional issues. The talks last for two years without any breakthroughs.

The Oslo Accords Secret negotiations in Norway result in the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, also known as the Oslo Accords. Before the accords are signed, Israel and the PLO recognize each other in an exchange of letters. Israel and the PLO agree to the creation of the Palestinian Authority to temporarily administer the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Israel also agrees to begin withdrawing from parts of the West Bank, though large swaths of land and Israeli settlements remain under the Israeli military’s exclusive control. The Oslo Accords envision a peace agreement by 1999.

Hezbollah had been exchanging aerial attacks with Israel since October 7. But the conflict escalates in September after Israel launches a coordinated attack against Hezbollah operatives using explosive pager devices. In the following weeks, Israel launches a series of aerial attacks that kill the group’s longtime leader as well as other senior Hezbollah members. Then, in October, Israeli forces mount a ground invasion in Southern Lebanon aimed at dismantling the group.

However, within months, both sides begin accusing each other of violating the terms of the agreement. In March, Israel launches renewed airstrikes and blocks aid and energy going into Gaza, and in May, it renews full-scale ground operations. Meanwhile, ongoing attempts to mediate a new ceasefire agreement remain unsuccessful. After more than a year of fighting, Israel and Hamas remain in conflict. Nearly 60,000 Palestinians have been killed, many of them civilians. Over fifty Israeli hostages are still held by Hamas. More on this topic.

Explore the history and important events behind the long-standing Middle East conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians from 1947 to today.
Smoke rises in Gaza following Israeli strikes on October 9, 2023.
The conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians reflects a long-standing struggle in the region encompassing the land between the Jordan River to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. That conflict has deep historical roots, shaped by statehood claims from the Israelis and the Palestinians that have been supported by various international agendas and activities over time.
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict dates back more than a century, with flashpoints building from the United Nations’ 1947 initial UN Partition Plan to the 1973 Yom Kippur War, to the recent Israel-Hamas war sparked in October 2023.
Despite continued efforts at brokering peace—including the 1978 Camp David Accords, the Oslo Accords of the 1990s, and the 2020 Abraham Accords—conflict has persisted.
This timeline explores some of the pivotal moments in the conflict from 1947 to today.
The UN General Assembly passes Resolution 181 calling for the partition of the Palestinian territories into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. The resolution also envisions an international, UN-run body to administer Jerusalem. The Palestinian territories had been under the military and administrative control of the United Kingdom (known as a mandate) since the 1917 defeat of the Ottoman Empire in World War I. Civil strife and violence between the Jewish and Arab communities of the Palestinian territories intensifies.
Israel declares its independence as the British rule ends. Sparked by Israel’s declaration of independence, the first Arab-Israeli War begins. Egypt (supported by Saudi Arabian, Sudanese, and Yemeni troops), Iraq, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria invade Israel. The fighting continues until 1949, when Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, and Syria sign armistice agreements.
Over the course of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, at least seven hundred thousand Palestinian refugees flee their homes in an exodus known to Palestinians as the nakba (Arabic for “catastrophe”). Israel wins the war, retaining the territory provided to it by the United Nations and capturing some of the areas designated for the imagined future Palestinian state. Israel gains control of West Jerusalem, Egypt gains the Gaza Strip, and Jordan gains the West Bank and East Jerusalem, including the Old City and its historic Jewish quarter. In 1948, the UN General Assembly passes Resolution 194, which calls for the repatriation of Palestinian refugees. The Palestinians will later point to Resolution 194 as having established a “right of return” for Palestinian refugees and their descendants. The specific parameters of that return are debated in the decades that follow, including among many descendants from the 1948 refugees and the three hundred thousand Palestinians who will flee their homes during the June 1967 war.
Israel and several of its Arab neighbors fight the Six-Day War. Israel wins a decisive victory: it suffers seven hundred casualties; its adversaries suffer nearly twenty thousand. Israel emerges with control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip—areas inhabited primarily by Palestinians—as well as all of East Jerusalem. Israel also takes control of Syria’s Golan Heights and the Sinai Peninsula, which is part of Egypt. Israel will stay in the Sinai Peninsula until April 1982.
The UN Security Council passes Resolution 242 calling for Israeli “withdrawal … from territories occupied in the recent conflict” and for the termination of “states of belligerency and respect for and acknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity, and political independence of every state in the area and the right to live in peace within secure and recognized boundaries.” The resolution establishes the concept of land for peace.
Another Arab-Israeli war, known variously as the Yom Kippur War, the Ramadan War, and the October War, is fought when Egypt and Syria attempt to retake the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula and Golan Heights. Cold War tensions spike as the Soviet Union aids Egypt and Syria and the United States aids Israel. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries begins an oil embargo on countries that support Israel, and the price of oil skyrockets. The fighting ends after a UN-sponsored ceasefire (negotiated by the United States and the Soviet Union) takes hold. The UN Security Council passes Resolution 338, which calls for implementing UN Security Council Resolution 242.
Israel and Egypt sign the Camp David Accords, which establish a basis for a peace treaty between the two countries. The accords also commit the Israeli and Egyptian governments, along with other parties, to negotiate the disposition of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Egypt and Israel sign a peace treaty, the first between Israel and one of its Arab neighbors. The treaty commits Israel to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula and evacuate its settlements there. The termination of the state of war between Egypt and Israel leads to the normalization of diplomatic and commercial relations between the two countries. Israel’s prime minister and Egypt’s president exchange letters reaffirming their commitment—outlined in the Camp David Accords—to negotiate the disposition of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
An Israeli driver kills four Palestinians in a car accident that sparks the first intifada, or uprising, against Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza. The image of Palestinians throwing rocks at Israeli tanks becomes the enduring image of the intifada. Over the next six years, roughly 200 Israelis and 1,300 Palestinians are killed.
A Palestinian cleric named Sheikh Ahmed Yassin establishes the militant group Hamas as an offshoot of the Muslim Brotherhood. Hamas endorses jihad as a way to regain territory for Muslims; the United States designates Hamas a foreign terrorist organization in 1997.
King Hussein of Jordan relinquishes his country’s claims to the West Bank and East Jerusalem in favor of the claims of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO). In December of the same year, PLO Chairman Yasir Arafat denounces violence, recognizes Israel’s right to exist, and acknowledges UN Security Council Resolution 242 and the concept of land for peace. The United States responds to Arafat’s announcement by beginning direct talks with him, though it suspends the talks following a Palestinian terrorist attack against Israel.
The Madrid Peace Conference begins, sponsored jointly by the United States and the Soviet Union. Israeli, Jordanian, Lebanese, Palestinian, and Syrian delegates attend the first negotiations among those parties. The talks proceed along bilateral tracks between Israel and its neighbors, though the Lebanese join the Syrian delegation and the Jordanian team includes Palestinian representatives. A multilateral track includes the wider Arab world and addresses regional issues. The talks last for two years without any breakthroughs.
Secret negotiations in Norway result in the Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government Arrangements, also known as the Oslo Accords. Before the accords are signed, Israel and the PLO recognize each other in an exchange of letters. Israel and the PLO agree to the creation of the Palestinian Authority to temporarily administer the Gaza Strip and West Bank. Israel also agrees to begin withdrawing from parts of the West Bank, though large swaths of land and Israeli settlements remain under the Israeli military’s exclusive control. The Oslo Accords envision a peace agreement by 1999. Palestinian leader Arafat, Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, and Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres win the Nobel Peace Prize in 1994 for their efforts on the Oslo Accords.
The Israelis and the Palestinians sign the Gaza-Jericho Agreement, which begins implementation of the Oslo Accords. The agreement provides for an Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and Jericho, a town in the West Bank, and for a transfer of authority from Israeli administration to the newly formed Palestinian Authority. The agreement also establishes the structure and composition of the Palestinian Authority, its jurisdiction and legislative powers, a Palestinian police force, and relations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Arafat returns to the Gaza Strip after a long absence.

Hamas operatives kidnap an Israeli soldier named Gilad Shalit on Israeli soil near the Gaza Strip. The Israeli military tries and fails to free him. He is held captive in Gaza until Israel—with the help of Egypt and the United States—negotiates his release in 2012.
Israel attacks the Gaza Strip following nearly eight hundred rocket attacks from Gaza on Israeli towns in the months of November and December. The war lasts less than a month but kills hundreds of civilians, in addition to hundreds of combatants, and sparks international criticism.
Secretary of State John Kerry seeks to restart final status negotiations. The process begins with the Israeli’s agreement to release 104 Palestinian prisoners and the Palestinians’ agreement not to use their new observer state status at the United Nations to advance the cause of statehood. Negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority collapsed in April 2014 over such issues as Israeli settlement growth, the status of a final round of prisoners, and Palestinian attempts to join several international organizations.
The PLO and Hamas sign an agreement to form a unity government. Tensions between the factions remain, however, and no unity government is formed. Gaza and the West Bank remain disconnected and under the control of rival Palestinian leaderships.
After tit-for-tat attacks on Israeli and Palestinian civilians by extremists on both sides, Israel invades the Gaza Strip. The operation, code-named Protective Edge, lasts for fifty days, killing about two thousand Gazans, sixty-six Israeli soldiers, and five Israeli civilians. Unlike the conflicts from 2008 to 2009 and in 2012, Palestinian rocket fire targets major Israeli cities. The war ends after the United States, in consultation with Egypt, Israel, and other regional powers, brokers a ceasefire.

The Israel-Palestinian conflict is one of the world’s most controversial and longstanding conflicts. At its heart, it is a fight over the same territory between two self-determination movements: the Zionist project and the Palestinian nationalist project, yet is an immensely complicated war, one that has deepened religious and political divides for decades. The current conflict began in the early 20th century, when Jews fleeing persecution wanted to establish a national homeland in what was then an Arab – and Muslim – majority territory. The Arabs resisted, seeking the establishment of their own state after years of rule by the Ottoman and later British Empire. An early UN plan to portion some of the land to each group failed, and several bloody wars were fought over the territory. Today’s boundaries largely indicate the outcomes of two of those wars, one waged in 1948 and the other in 1967.

First Arab-Israeli War (1948-49) The First Arab Israeli War commenced following the end of the British Mandate for Palestine on 14 May 1948, and the Israeli Declaration of Independence that had occurred that same day. After 10 months of fighting, armistice agreements left Israel with more territory than was allocated in the 1947 Partition Plan, including West Jerusalem. Jordan took control and subsequently annexed the remainder of the British Mandate territories including much of the West Bank, while Egypt occupied Gaza. Of a total population of around 1,200,000 people, around 750,000 Palestinian Arabs either fled or were driven out of their territories. 2. Six Day War (1967) In 1950 Egypt blocked the the Straits of Tiran from Israeli shipping, and in 1956 Israel invaded the Sinai peninsula during the Suez Crisis with the objective of reopening them. Though Israel was forced to retreat, they were assured that the shipping route would remain open and a United Nations Emergency Force were deployed along the border of the two countries. In 1967 however, Egyptian President Nasser once again blocked the Straits of Tiran to Israel and replaced the UNEF troops with his own forces. In retaliation Israel launched a pre-emptive airstrike attack on Egypt’s air bases, and Syria and Jordan then joined the war. Lasting 6 days, the war left Israel in control of East Jerusalem, Gaza, Golan Heights, Sinai and all of the West Bank, with Jewish settlements established in these areas to help consolidate control. As a result of the Six-Day War, Israelis gained access to important Jewish holy sites, including the Wailing Wall. Credit: Wikimedia Commons 3. Munich Olympics (1972) At the 1972 Munich Olympics, 8 members of the Palestinian terrorist group ‘Black September’ took the Israeli team hostage. 2 athletes were murdered at the site and a further 9 were taken hostage, with the group’s leader Luttif Afif demanding the release of 234 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel and the founders of the Red Army Faction who were being held by the West Germans. A failed rescue attempt by the German authorities ensued in which all 9 hostages were killed alongside 5 members of Black September, with the Israeli government launching Operation Wrath of God to hunt down and kill anyone involved in the plot. 4. Camp David Accord (1977) In May, Menachem Begin’s right-wing Likud party won a surprise election victory in Israel, bringing religious Jewish parties into the mainstream and encouraging settlements and economic liberalisation. In November, Egyptian President Anwar Sadat visited Jerusalem and began the process that would lead to Israel’s withdrawal from Sinai and Egypt’s recognition of Israel in the Camp David Accords. The Accords also pledged Israel to expand Palestinian autonomy in Gaza and the West Bank. Dan Snow visits the RRS Discovery in Dundee, the first Antarctic scientific research vessel.Watch Now 5. Invasion of Lebanon (1982) In June, Israel invaded Lebanon in order to expel the Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) leadership after an assassination attempt on the Israeli ambassador to London. In September, the massacre of Palestinians in the Sabra and Shatila camps in Beirut by Israel’s Christian Phalangist allies led to mass protests and calls for the Defence Minister, Ariel Sharon, to be removed from office. A hung-parliament in July 1984 led to an uneasy coalition between Likud and Labour, and in June 1985 Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon but continued to occupy a narrow ‘security zone’ along the border. 6. First Palestinian Intifada (1987-1993) In 1987 Palestinians in Israel began to protest their marginalised position and agitated for national independence. With Israel’s settler population in the West Bank almost doubling in the mid-1980s, a growing Palestinian militancy agitated against the de-facto annexation that seemed to be taking place. Although around 40% of the Palestinian workforce worked in Israel, they were mostly employed in jobs of unskilled or semi-skilled nature. In 1988 Yasser Arafat formally declared the establishment of a Palestinian state, despite the fact that the PLO had no control over any territory and was held to be a terrorist organisation by Israel. The First Intifada became a largely spontaneous series of demonstrations, nonviolent actions like mass boycotts and Palestinians refusing to work in Israel, and attacks (such as with rocks, Molotov cocktails and occasionally firearms) on Israelis. Dan Snow explores one of the most daring and dangerous aerial attacks of World War II.Watch Now During the six-year Intifada, the Israeli army killed from 1,162-1,204 Palestinians – 241 being children – and arrested more than 120,000. One journalistic calculation reports that in the Gaza Strip alone from 1988 to 1993, some 60,706 Palestinians suffered injuries from shootings, beatings or tear gas. 7. Oslo Declaration (1993) Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took steps toward peace between their two countries, mediated by Bill Clinton. They planned Palestinian self-government and formally concluded the First Intifada. Violence from Palestinian groups who reject the Declaration continues to this day. Between May and July 1994, Israel withdrew from most of Gaza and Jericho, allowing Yasser Arafat to move the PLO administration from Tunis and to establish Palestinian National Authority. Jordan and Israel also signed a peace treaty in October. In 1993 Yasser Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin took steps toward peace between their two countries mediated by Bill Clinton. The Interim Agreement for the transfer of further autonomy and territory to the Palestinian National Authority in September 1995 paved the way for the 1997 Hebron Protocol, 1998 Wye River Memorandum, and the 2003 ‘Road Map for Peace’. This was despite Likud’s electoral success in May 1996 which saw Benjamin Netanyahu come to power – Netanyahu did pledge to halt further concessions and settlement expansion resumed however. 8. Pullout from Lebanon (2000) In May, Israel withdrew from southern Lebanon. Two months later however, talks between Prime Minister Barak and Yasser Arafat broke down over the timing and extent of proposed further Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank. In September, Likud leader Ariel Sharon visited the site in Jerusalem known to Jews as Temple Mount and to Arabs as Al-Haram-al-Sharif. This highly-provocative visit sparked new violence, known as the Second Intifada. 9. Second Palestinian Intifada – 2000-2005 A new wave of violent protests erupted between the Palestinians and Israelis following Sharon’s visit to Temple Mount/Al-Haram-al-Sharif – Sharon then went on to become Prime Minister of Israel in January 2001, and refused to continue peace talks. Between March and May in 2002, the Israeli army launched Operation Defensive Shield on the West Bank after a significant number of Palestinian suicide bombings – the largest military operation on the West Bank since 1967. In June 2002 the Israelis started to build a barrier around the West Bank; it frequently deviated from the agreed pre-1967 ceasefire line into the West Bank. The 2003 Road Map – as proposed by the EU, the USA, Russia and the UN – attempted to resolve the conflict and both Palestinians and Israelis supported the plan.

Withdrawal from Gaza (2005) In September, Israel withdrew all Jewish settlers and military from Gaza, but maintained control over airspace, coastal waters and border crossings. At the start of 2006, Hamas won the Palestinian elections. Rocket attacks from Gaza escalated, and were met with rising Israeli violence in retaliation. In June, Hamas took Gilad Shalit, an Israeli soldier, hostage and tensions rose sharply. He was eventually released in October 2011 in exchange for 1,027 prisoners in a deal brokered by Germany and Egypt. Between July and August, there was an Israeli incursion into Lebanon, which escalated into the Second Lebanon War. In November 2007, the Annapolis Conference established a ‘two-state solution’ for the first time as a basis for future peace talks between the Palestinian Authority and Israel. Dr Chris Smith has written a fascinating book about John Cairncross, one of the famous five Cambridge spies who infiltrated high positions in the British intelligence service and reported back to Russia. Kim Philby, the most famous of the spies, was almost in charge of MI6 before his associate was detected, and intelligence officers grew suspicious. Listen Now 11. Gaza Invasion (2008) In December Israel launched a month-long full-scale invasion to prevent Hamas staging further attacks. Between 1,166 and 1,417 Palestinians were killed; the Israeli’s lost 13 men. 12. Netanyahu’s fourth government (2015) In May, Netanyahu formed a new coalition government with the right-wing Bayit Yehudi party. Another right-wing party, Yisrael Beitenu, joined the following year. In November, Israel suspended contact with European Union officials who had been in talks with Palestinians over the decision to label goods from Jewish settlements as coming from settlements, not from Israel. In December 2016 Israel broke ties with 12 countries that voted for a Security Council resolution condemning settlement building. This occurred after the US abstained from its vote for the first time, rather than using its veto. In June 2017 the first new Jewish settlement in the West Bank for 25 years started construction. It followed after a law was passed that retroactively legalised dozens of Jewish settlements that were built on private Palestinian land in the West Bank. 13. US raised the military aid package to Israel (2016) In September 2016 the US agreed a military aid package worth $38bn over the next 10 years – the largest deal of its kind in US history. The previous pact, which expired in 2018, saw Israel receive $3.1bn each year. 14. US President Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as Israel’s capital (2017) In an unprecedented move, Donald Trump recognised Jerusalem as the capital, causing further upset and divides in the Arab world and drawing condemnation from some Western allies. In 2019, he declared himself ‘history’s most pro-Israel U.S. president’. 15. A ceasefire between Israel and Palestine was brokered (2018) The UN and Egypt attempted to broker a long-term ceasefire between the two states, following a steep rise in bloodshed on the Gaza border. Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Liberman resigned in protest at the ceasefire, and withdrew the Yisrael Beteinu party from the coalition government. For two weeks after the ceasefire a number of protests and minor incidents took place, however their intensity gradually decreased. 16. Renewed violence threatens war (2021) In Spring 2021, the site of Temple Mount/Al-Haram-al-Sharif again became a political battlefield when a number of clashes between Israeli police and Palestinians ensued over Ramadan. Hamas issued the Israeli police an ultimatum to remove their forces from the site which, when unmet, was followed by rockets fired into southern Israel – over the coming days over 3,000 continued to be sent into the area by Palestinian militants. In retaliation dozens of Israeli air strikes on Gaza followed, destroying tower blocks and militant tunnel systems, with many civilians and Hamas officials killed. In towns with mixed Jewish and Arab populations mass unrest broke out in the streets causing hundreds of arrests, with Lod near Tel Aviv declaring a state of emergency. With the easing of tensions unlikely, the UN fears a ‘full scale war’ between the two sides may loom on the horizon as the decades-old crisis continues. Tags: Donald Trump

Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained14 October 2025Getty ImagesThe conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running and most violent disputes in the world. Its origins go back more than a century.There have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place.The consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the latest war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.What was Israel before 1948 and how was it created?Britain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East.An Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups.Tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a "national home" in Palestine for Jewish people - a pledge known as the Balfour Declaration.Jews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected.Getty ImagesBetween the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven.The Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947.In 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city.No Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller.Britain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948.Jewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year.What was the 1948 Arab-Israeli war?The day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations.The conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence.Getty ImagesA Haganah (Jewish Underground) fighter just before the start of the Israeli war of independence in 1948By the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory.Agreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem.About 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees.The event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe).Getty ImagesArab Legion soldiers fire on fighters of the Haganah, the Jewish Agency self-defence force, in March 1948In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel.What was the 1967 Middle East war?What is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians.The war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan.It started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force.By the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.About a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control.Getty ImagesIsraeli military commanders arrive in East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967Israel's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day.Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai.It annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community.What is the status of the West Bank now?The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians.Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.The Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community.Israel still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its towns and cities.There are about 160 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.Palestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law.However, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights.It does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland.The Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022. It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security.In July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid.There has been a sharp escalation in attacks by settlers against Palestinian villages since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.According to a report by the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs, there were 2,208 attacks by settlers against Palestinians resulting in casualties or property damage between January 2024 and June 2025.Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West BankIsrael's borders explained in mapsWhat is the dispute over Jerusalem?Israel and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital.Israel, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided.The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.Most of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens.Getty ImagesHoly sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem.The UN considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel.What has happened in the Gaza Strip?The Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.Home to about 2.1 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.Even before the latest war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive.Gaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt.Egypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule.In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods.The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory.In the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. A major conflict between the two sides in May 2021 ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.Every round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.Getty ImagesOn 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking 251 hostages.This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive, by land, sea and air.

Israel and the Palestinians: History of the conflict explained
The conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people is one of the longest-running and most violent disputes in the world. Its origins go back more than a century.
There have been a series of wars between Israel and Arab nations. Uprisings - called intifadas - against Israeli occupation, and reprisals and crackdowns by Israel have also taken place.
The consequences of the historic dispute over issues including land, borders and rights are still being felt, and include the latest war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.
What was Israel before 1948 and how was it created?
Britain took control of the area known as Palestine in World War One, following the defeat of the Ottoman Empire, which had ruled that part of the Middle East.
An Arab majority and a Jewish minority lived there, as well as other ethnic groups.
Tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations deepened when the UK agreed in principle to the establishment of a "national home" in Palestine for Jewish people - a pledge known as the Balfour Declaration.
Jews had historical links to the land, but Palestinian Arabs also had a claim dating back centuries and opposed the move. The British said the rights of Palestinian Arabs already living there had to be protected.
Between the 1920s and 1940s the number of Jews arriving grew, with many fleeing persecution in Europe. The murder of six million Jews during the Holocaust gave added urgency to demands for a safe haven.
The Jewish population reached 630,000, just over 30% of the population, by 1947.
In 1947, against a backdrop of growing violence between Jews and Arabs - and against British rule - the United Nations (UN) voted for Palestine to be split into separate Jewish and Arab states. Jerusalem would become an international city.
No Arab nations supported this. They argued the plan gave the Jews more of the land, even though their population was smaller.
Britain abstained. It decided to withdraw and to hand the problem to the UN at the end of 14 May 1948.
Jewish leaders in Palestine declared an independent state known as Israel hours before British rule ended. Israel was recognised by the UN the following year.
The day after Israel declared independence, it was attacked and surrounded by the armies of five Arab nations.
The conflict came to be known in Israel as its war of independence.
By the time the fighting ended with an armistice in 1949, Israel controlled most of the territory.
Agreements left Egypt occupying the Gaza Strip, Jordan occupying the West Bank and East Jerusalem, and Israel occupying West Jerusalem.
About 750,000 Palestinians fled, or were forced from, their homes on land which became Israel and ended up as refugees.
The event is known in Arabic as the Nakba (Catastrophe).
In the years that followed, hundreds of thousands of Jews left, or were expelled from, Muslim majority countries across the Middle East and North Africa, with many going to Israel.
What is known as the Six-Day War changed boundaries in the Middle East and had major consequences for Palestinians.
The war saw Israel fight Egypt, Syria and Jordan.
It started when Israel, fearing an attack by Egypt and Syria, launched a strike on Egypt's air force.
By the time the fighting ended, Israel had captured the Sinai Peninsula and Gaza from Egypt, most of the Golan Heights from Syria, and East Jerusalem and the West Bank from Jordan.
About a million Palestinians in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem came under Israel's control.
Israel's occupation of these areas has lasted until this day.
Israel signed a peace treaty with Egypt in 1979 and returned the Sinai.
It annexed East Jerusalem and the Golan Heights, making them part of Israel, although this has not been recognised by most of the international community.
The West Bank - land between Israel and the River Jordan - is home to an estimated three million Palestinians.
Along with East Jerusalem and Gaza, it is part of what are widely known as the Occupied Palestinian Territories.
The Palestinians have always opposed Israel's presence in these areas and want them to be part of a future independent state, something backed by the vast majority of the international community.
Israel still has overall control of the West Bank, but since the 1990s, a Palestinian government - known as the Palestinian Authority - has run most of its towns and cities.
There are about 160 Israeli settlements, housing about 700,000 Jews, in the West Bank and East Jerusalem.
Palestinians want all Israeli settlements to be removed and they are considered illegal under international law.
However, Israel's government disputes this. It says the biggest settlements at the very least are permanent and that all settlements are rooted in its historical rights.
It does not recognise the right of the Palestinians to have their own state and argues that the West Bank is part of the Israeli homeland.
The Israeli government announced plans to expand settlements after coming to power in 2022. It says the creation of a Palestinian state would be a threat to Israeli security.
In July 2024, the top court of the UN, the International Court of Justice (ICJ), said that Israel's continued presence in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is illegal. It said that Israel should withdraw all settlers and that it was in breach of international agreements on racism and apartheid.
There has been a sharp escalation in attacks by settlers against Palestinian villages since the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.
According to a report by the UN Office for Humanitarian Affairs, there were 2,208 attacks by settlers against Palestinians resulting in casualties or property damage between January 2024 and June 2025.
Confronting violent settlers in the occupied West Bank
Israel and the Palestinians both claim Jerusalem as their capital.
Israel, which already controlled West Jerusalem, occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later declared the entire city its permanent capital. It says Jerusalem cannot be divided.
The Palestinians claim East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state.
Most of the population of East Jerusalem is Palestinian, only a small minority of whom have chosen to become Israeli citizens.
Holy sites in Jerusalem are at the centre of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. The most sacred site - known to Muslims as Al Aqsa Mosque compound, or Haram al-Sharif (Noble Sanctuary), and to Jews as Temple Mount - lies in East Jerusalem.
The UN considers East Jerusalem to be Palestinian land occupied by Israel.
The Gaza Strip is a stretch of land surrounded by Israel, Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. It is 41km (25 miles) long and 10km wide.
Home to about 2.1 million people, it is one of the most densely populated places on Earth.
Even before the latest war between Israel and Hamas, Gaza had one of the highest unemployment rates in the world. Many people were living below the poverty line and depending on food aid to survive.
Gaza's boundaries were drawn up as a result of the 1948 Middle East war, when it was occupied by Egypt.
Egypt was driven out of Gaza in the 1967 war and the Strip was occupied by Israel, which built settlements and placed Gaza's Palestinian population under military rule.
In 2005, Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods.
The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has.
Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006, and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year.
Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade in response, with Israel controlling most of what was allowed into the territory.
In the years that followed, Hamas and Israel fought several major conflicts - including those in 2008-09, 2012 and 2014. A major conflict between the two sides in May 2021 ended in a ceasefire after 11 days.
Every round of fighting has seen people killed on both sides, the vast majority of them Palestinians in Gaza.
On 7 October 2023, Hamas fighters launched an assault from Gaza, killing about 1,200 people in Israel and taking 251 hostages.
This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive, by land, sea and air.
More than 67,000 people in Gaza - mostly civilians, about half of whom were women and children - have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry.
In July, the UK and 27 other nations, including Australia, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, New Zealand and Switzerland called for an immediate end to the war. They said the suffering of civilians had "reached new depths".
The same month, UN-backed experts warned the "worst-case scenario of famine is currently playing out" in the Gaza Strip.

Israel pulled its troops back to an agreed position, and allowed more aid to enter the Strip. Hamas returned the remaining 20 living Israeli hostages, while Israel freed almost 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees.
Negotiations continue over the details of the later phases of the peace deal.

Which countries recognise a Palestinian state?
The State of Palestine is currently recognised by more than 150 of the UN's 193 member states.
Known as the State of Palestine at the UN, it has an official status of "Permanent Observer State", which gives it a seat but not a vote.
Some countries, including the US, do not recognise a Palestinian state and have said they will only do so as part of a long-term political solution to the conflict in the Middle East.
However, in September 2025, the UK, France, Canada, Australia, Portugal and several other European states all announced recognition.
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted to "revive the hope of peace and a two-state solution". French President Emmanuel Macron said "the time for peace has come" and that "nothing justifies the ongoing war in Gaza".
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the moves, saying they rewarded Hamas for the 7 October attack. Israel says it has a historical right to the West Bank and opposes an independent Palestinian state, saying it would pose an unacceptable threat.
The Trump administration is against recognising a Palestinian state, arguing it would be a reward for Hamas and make it harder to end the war in Gaza.
Why some Palestinians aren't convinced by Starmer's promise
What does recognising a Palestinian state mean?
There are about 5.9 million Palestinians registered by the UN as refugees.
They are descendants of the Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes on land which became Israel in the 1948-49 Middle East war.
Most live in Jordan, the Gaza Strip, the West Bank, Syria and Lebanon.
Palestinians insist on the right of refugees to return but Israel has refused this. It criticises the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, for allowing refugee status to be inherited by successive generations.
The "two-state solution" is an internationally backed formula for peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
It proposes an independent Palestinian state in the West Bank and Gaza, with East Jerusalem as its capital. It would exist alongside Israel.
Israel rejects a two-state solution. It says any final settlement must be the result of negotiations with the Palestinians, and statehood should not be a precondition.
The Palestinian Authority backs a two-state solution but Hamas does not because it is opposed to the existence of Israel.
Hamas says that it could accept an interim Palestinian state based on 1967 de facto borders, without officially recognising Israel, if refugees were given the right to return.
Earlier efforts to settle the conflict saw Israel and Palestinian leaders sign a deal called the Oslo Peace Accords, in 1993. This was intended to provide a framework for peace talks. However, talks eventually collapsed with each side blaming the other.

Economic crisis worsens in Occupied Palestinian Territory amid ongoing Gaza conflict
12 September 2024 A UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) report reveals a severe economic crisis, driven by collapsing GDP per capita, widespread poverty and soaring unemployment. Default image copyright and description © UN Photo/Stephenie Hollyman Economic collapse: Gaza's GDP has plunged by 81%, leaving its economy in ruins.Surging poverty and unemployment: Massive job losses have worsened poverty and humanitarian crises.West Bank disruption: Violence and trade restrictions have severely crippled the West Bank's economy.Fiscal strain: Revenue cuts and reduced aid are crippling the Palestinian government's ability to function.Call for action: The report urges immediate international intervention to stabilize the economy and support peace efforts.UN Trade and Development (UNCTAD) has released a comprehensive report detailing the profound economic destruction that has gripped the Occupied Palestinian Territory in the aftermath of the Israeli military operation in Gaza that followed the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas.The report highlights the staggering scale of economic devastation and unprecedented decline in economic activity, far surpassing the impact of all previous military confrontations in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021. Inflationary pressures combined with soaring unemployment and collapsing incomes, have severely impoverished Palestinian households.War destruction extends to the West Bank and East JerusalemThe military operation led to unprecedented loss of life, displacement, and widespread destruction of infrastructure. Meanwhile, the West Bank experienced a surge in violence, demolition of Palestinian assets, confiscations, and settlement expansions. The combined impact of the military operation in Gaza and its repercussions in the West Bank delivered an unparalleled shock that overwhelmed the Palestinian economy across the Occupied Territory, including East Jerusalem.By early 2024, between 80% to 96% of Gaza's agricultural assets -including irrigation systems, livestock farms, orchards, machinery, and storage facilities - had been decimated, crippling the region's food production capacity and worsening already high levels of food insecurity. The destruction also hit the private sector hard, with 82% of businesses, a key driver of Gaza’s economy, damaged or destroyed. The damage to the productive base has continued to worsen as the military operation persists.Gaza's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) plummeted by 81%in the last quarter of 2023, leading to a 22% contraction for the entire year. By mid-2024 Gaza's economy had shrunk to less than one-sixth of its 2022 level. Meanwhile, the West Bank has been undergoing a rapid and alarming economic decline. The report highlights factors such as settlement expansion, land confiscations, demolition of Palestinian structures, and increased settler violence throughout 2023 -2024 to have displaced communities and severely impacted economic activities. These disruptions have affected various sectors across the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, where commerce, tourism and transportation have suffered a considerable downturn. As a result, 80%of businesses in the East Jerusalem Old City have either partially or completely ceased operations.The initial optimism of a 4% GDP growth in the West Bank during the first three quarters of 2023 was abruptly reversed by an unprecedented 19% contraction in the fourth quarter. This sharp downturn resulted in an overall annual GDP decline of 1.9%. Additionally, per capita GDP decreased by 4.5%, indicating a substantial drop in living standards and household incomes.Mass unemployment and growing povertyLabor market conditions in the West Bank have deteriorated significantly, with 96% of businesses reporting decreased activity and 42.1% reducing their workforce. A total of 306,000 jobs have been lost, pushing West Bank’s unemployment rates from 12.9% before the conflict to 32%. These job losses have resulted in an estimated daily labor income loss of $25.5 million, severely eroding the economic resilience of Palestinian households and exacerbating social hardships.The situation in Gaza is particularly dire, with two-thirds of pre-war jobs—approximately 201,000 positions— lost by January 2024. This has further worsened the already critical economic and humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip.In the West Bank, trade activities have been severely disrupted due to increased restrictions on the movement of people and goods. The number of checkpoints across the occupied West Bank rose from 567 in early October 2023 to 700 by February 2024, significantly hindering economic activity.Poverty has been widespread and growing in recent years. By 2022, one-third of the Palestinian population (1.84 million people) was food insecure (lacking consistent access to sufficient and nutritious food), or severely food insecure, and 31.1 per cent lived in poverty. Before October 2023, 80% of Gaza’s population depended on international assistance. Currently, poverty affects nearly the entire population of Gaza and is rising rapidly in the West Bank.Deductions and revenue withholding undermine the Palestinian AuthorityThe Palestinian government's fiscal stability is under immense pressure, jeopardizing its ability to function effectively and provide essential services. Despite efforts at fiscal reform, the government's fiscal capacity has been eroded by slow GDP growth, revenue deductions by Israel, and a sharp decline in international aid. In 2023, international donor support fell to its lowest level at $358 million equivalent to just 2% of GDP, down from $2 billion, or 27% of GDP in 2008.Since October 2023, revenue deductions and withholdings by Israel have escalated totaling over $1.4 billion between 2019 and April 2024. This amount represents 8.1% of Palestine's GDP in 2023, leading to significant budgetary shortfalls. These fiscal challenges have hampered the government's ability to pay employees, service debts, and maintain critical public services such as healthcare and education. The situation has also led to growing debt, delayed payments to private suppliers, and reduced social transfers to the poor. Public employees have only been paid partial salaries since November 2021.A path forwardThe performance of the Palestinian economy has been heavily influenced by external factors, particularly measures taken by Israel and, to a lesser extent, by fluctuations in aid flows. UNCTAD stresses that prolonged occupation remains the main obstacle to sustainable economic development. Persistent restrictions on investment, labor mobility and trade have systematically undermined economic potential, exacerbating poverty and instability.The report echoes the UN Secretary-General's call for urgent measures to support and strengthen Palestinian institutions, highlighting the need to enhance peacebuilding efforts. Prolonged occupation is a primary economic obstacle to sustainable development due to ongoing restrictions on investment, labor mobility, and trade.The report offers a comprehensive analysis of the severe economic challenges facing the Occupied Palestinian Territory. It calls for immediate and substantial intervention by the international community to halt the economic freefall, address the humanitarian crisis, and lay the groundwork for lasting peace and development. This includes considering a comprehensive recovery plan for the Occupied Palestinian Territory, increased international aid and support, release of withheld revenues and lifting the blockade on Gaza.UNCTAD’s role in the Occupied Palestinian TerritoryFor nearly four decades, UN Trade and Development has supported the Palestinian people through policy-oriented research, capacity-building and technical cooperation projects in partnership with public and private sector institutions and civil society.

Gaza facing worst economic collapse ever recorded, UN trade agency warns
The Occupied Palestinian Territory is now in its deepest economic crisis ever recorded, with Gaza suffering an “unprecedented and catastrophic” collapse, according to a new report from the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) presented in Geneva on Tuesday.
Speaking at the launch of UNCTAD’s 2025 Report on the Economy of the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the agency’s Deputy Secretary-General Pedro Manuel Moreno said decades of movement restrictions, combined with the latest military operations, had “wiped out decades of progress” and left both Gaza and the West Bank facing long-term devastation.
“What we see today is extremely worrying,” he said. “Gaza is going through the fastest and most damaging economic collapse ever recorded.”
UNCTAD’s data shows that in 2024, Gaza’s GDP collapsed by 83 per cent compared to the previous year.
GDP per capita fell to just $161 a year, less than 50 cents per day, among the lowest anywhere in the world
Gaza’s economy now stands at just 13 per cent of its 2022 size
Senior economist Mutasim Elagraa, who coordinates UNCTAD’s programme supporting the Palestinian people, said the collapse was so severe that it had erased seven decades of human development in the enclave.
“Gaza’s economy has lost 87 per cent of its value since 2022,” he said. “GDP per capita has reverted to levels seen 22 years ago. This is the worst economic crisis on record, anywhere in recent decades.”
Mr. Elagraa warned that national unemployment has hit 50 per cent, and unemployment in Gaza is now over 80 per cent. “Multidimensional poverty now engulfs all Gazans,” he added.
West Bank also facing its deepest downturn
The West Bank is experiencing its worst contraction ever recorded, with GDP falling by 17 per cent in 2024 and per-capita income dropping nearly 19 per cent.
intensified movement and access restrictions,
the loss of access to 60 per cent of West Bank land
has “suppressed the economy for decades” and severely limits future recovery.
Mr. Moreno said the fiscal situation facing the Palestinian government is now “the worst in its history”, driven by collapsing revenues and withheld fiscal transfers, which account for more than two-thirds of Palestinian tax income.
Education system destroyed — human capital 'set back a generation'
The report warns that the destruction of all schools and universities in Gaza has left children out of education for more than two years — a loss of human capital that will harm society “for generations to come.”
Mr. Elagraa said this alone represents the collapse of a quarter-century of human development, adding that “education, skills, and the entire human development base have been shattered. Gaza has lost 70 years of human development.”
$70 billion needed to rebuild — recovery will take decades
According to joint estimates by the UN, the European Union and the World Bank, more than $70 billion will be required to rebuild Gaza.
Mr. Elagraa said that even in the most optimistic scenario, with full access for reconstruction materials and generous international aid, “it will take decades for Gaza to regain the level of economic activity it had before the latest conflict.”
He added that simply removing rubble could take 22 years, based on past reconstruction efforts, and up to 10 years may be needed just to clear unexploded ordnance.
Ceasefire is essential — and humanitarian access “cannot wait”
All three UNCTAD speakers emphasised that no economic recovery is possible without a durable ceasefire.
Mr. Moreno said the ceasefire agreed in October 2025 offers a “critical opportunity” but warned that assistance must flow now.
“Humanitarian assistance cannot wait,” he said. “A lasting ceasefire is essential to stabilise the economy and allow reconstruction to begin.”
Mr. Elagraa added that development could only restart when:
movement and access restrictions are eased.
He described recent improvements as “positive but slow, frustrating but moving in the right direction.”
Agriculture devastated — 86 per cent of cropland damaged
UNCTAD confirmed that Gaza’s agricultural sector has been “severely crippled.”
Drawing on comments from UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan, officials said:
Only 1.5 per cent of farmland remains usable
89 per cent of water and sanitation facilities are destroyed
Soil contamination from explosives — detonated and unexploded — will require major international intervention.

The economy of the occupied Palestinian territory is facing its most severe collapse on record, driven by the scale of Israel’s genocidal war on Gaza and continued restrictions on movement and trade, according to a new United Nations report.
Published on Monday, the report by the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) said two years of Israeli military operations and longstanding curbs have pushed the occupied territory into an economic downturn now ranked among the 10 worst collapses recorded globally since 1960.

“Extensive damage to infrastructure, productive assets and public services has reversed decades of socioeconomic progress in the Occupied Palestinian Territory,” it said, referring to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, including East Jerusalem.
The situation in Gaza constitutes “the most severe economic crisis on record”, it warned.
The publication of the findings comes as Israeli attacks on Gaza continue, despite a six-week ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian group Hamas.
Israel’s assault began on October 7, 2023, after an attack on southern Israel by fighters from Hamas and other Palestinian groups, during which an estimated 1,139 people were killed and about 240 were taken into Gaza as captives.
In response, Israel unleashed a bombing campaign and tightened its longstanding blockade on Gaza, turning what had already been a 16-year siege into a total stranglehold. Its attacks have killed at least 69,733 people and wounded 170,863, with more than 300 killed since the start of the ceasefire last month.
According to the UNCTAD report, the Palestinian gross domestic product (GDP) had regressed to its 2010 level by the end of last year, while GDP per capita returned to the level seen in 2003, erasing 22 years of development in less than two years.
In Gaza, GDP plunged 83 percent in 2024 compared with the previous year, totalling an 87 percent drop over two years to $362m. GDP per capita plummeted to $161, placing it among the lowest in the world.
The report documented that nearly two decades of Israeli‐imposed blocks on trade, movement and access have generated near-total dependence on external aid, while Israeli attacks have damaged about 174,500 structures in Gaza, propelling the enclave into “utter ruin”.
Meanwhile, the occupied West Bank is also experiencing its most severe economic downturn on record, with movement and access restrictions and the collapse of jobs.
“Across the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the steepest economic contraction on record has wiped out decades of progress,” the report added.
The report says Israel’s withholding of fiscal revenues owed to the Palestinian Authority (PA) has significantly worsened the crisis, severely limiting the government’s ability to pay salaries, maintain services and finance reconstruction efforts.
The PA said on Monday that Israel was withholding $4bn of tax revenues.
UNCTAD estimated that the cost of reconstruction and recovery in Gaza alone will exceed $70bn and called for a comprehensive recovery plan that is backed by coordinated international assistance, the restoration of fiscal transfers and urgent measures to ease constraints on trade, movement and investment.
“Even with substantial aid, recovery to pre-October 2023 GDP levels could take decades,” it said.
The agency also warned that without immediate, large-scale intervention, the destruction caused by Israel’s war and systemic restrictions will trap the Palestinian economy in a long-term slump.
For any meaningful recovery, UNCTAD said, the ceasefire achieved in October must be durable.
“UNCTAD’s report calls for immediate and substantial intervention by the international community to halt the economic freefall, address the humanitarian crisis, and lay the groundwork for lasting peace and development,” it added.
