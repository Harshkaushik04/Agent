Within the initial days following the video going viral, the strongest lead on the Hawk Tuah Girl's identity is the name "Hailey Welch" or "Haliey Welch," which was commented by Tim & Dee on their original Instagram video and the later TikTok post. Her friend's name is purportedly Chelsea Bradford, who's also seen in the clip.

On Wednesday, Tennessee-based apparel company Fathead Threads posted two photos to its Facebook page showing the owner, Jason Poteete, standing with the "Hawk Tuah Girl." She's pictured with the same left arm tattoos from the original clip while wearing a hat that reads, "Hawk Tuah '24 Spit On That Thang." The post was made to promote her line of merch with the company, and she's seen in the second photo signing her name "Haliey" on the hats — confirming her identity is indeed Haliey Welch. At the moment, it still seems like she doesn't want the limelight too much because she remains difficult to track down. This might indicate that she's not too thrilled about "Hawk Tuah Girl" being her new nickname — or perhaps it's just the sudden and massive influx of attention that the subjects of big memes often face.

In a heated exchange on a live stream, cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla confronted members of the Hawk Tuah project team over allegations of a controversial token launch that reportedly cost investors millions. MY LATEST VIDEOSnextstay The confrontation centered around claims of insider trading and questionable tokenomics, with Coffeezilla asserting that over $1 million in fees were generated while investors suffered losses. “I’ve been tracing it on chain for a while. You guys generated over a million dollars in fees while y’all’s fans got rug pulled,” Coffeezilla stated during the discussion on X Spaces. ► Project team members strongly denied the allegations, with one representative claiming, “There’s no insider trading.” However, when pressed about the destination of the fees, team members indicated they went to a foundation in the Cayman Islands.

In a heated exchange on a live stream, cryptocurrency investigator Coffeezilla confronted members of the Hawk Tuah project team over allegations of a controversial token launch that reportedly cost investors millions.
The confrontation centered around claims of insider trading and questionable tokenomics, with Coffeezilla asserting that over $1 million in fees were generated while investors suffered losses.
“I’ve been tracing it on chain for a while. You guys generated over a million dollars in fees while y’all’s fans got rug pulled,” Coffeezilla stated during the discussion on X Spaces.
Project team members strongly denied the allegations, with one representative claiming, “There’s no insider trading.” However, when pressed about the destination of the fees, team members indicated they went to a foundation in the Cayman Islands.

Female bodybuilder who took Male hormones shares her take on trans competitors in women’s sports December 04, 2025 IFBB Pro bodybuilder Hannah Hussein has waded into the ongoing debate about trans athletes in women’s sports, offering what she describes as a “unique perspective” as someone who has taken male hormones for competitive advantage. In a recent video addressing her followers, Hussein explained her position stems from personal experience with anabolic ster**ds at levels that put her “well into the male range” – far beyond typical testosterone replacement therapy. Despite the dramatic physical changes, including voice deepening and significant strength and muscle gains, she says she could never replicate the structural advantages that come from male puberty. “I still could never match the structural advantages that come from going through male puberty,” Hussein stated. “I’m talking about things that I could never change no matter how many hormones I took. Bone structure, tendon thickness, muscle fiber distribution, leverage, and even lung capacity. Those are not things that can be reduced with medication. Those are fundamental.” The bodybuilder illustrated her point with a striking anecdote: “I had a male client come in who had never lifted a weight in his life and within a year he was deadlifting my max for reps.” She added that despite over a decade in the gym, most of it while using st**oids, “most women athletes simply will never surpass or even match the strength of a male athlete.” Hussein was careful to clarify her stance on transgender people themselves. “I don’t believe there’s anything wrong with being trans,” she emphasized. “I believe that as long as you’re not harming anyone and you’re not pushing your agenda or your values onto anybody else, you should be able to live your life the way you want to in the way that makes you happy.” However, when it comes to competition, she draws a firm line. “From my perspective, as a woman who has taken male hormones, I personally do not believe that it’s fair for someone who went through male puberty to compete in women’s divisions,” Hussein said, emphasizing her support for fairness to “female athletes who have trained as females and in female physiology their entire lives.” Hussein stressed she wants all athletes, including trans athletes, to compete, but believes “the solution should be fair for everybody.” She explained that women’s sports exist precisely because of biological disadvantages in strength, power, and speed compared to men, calling androgens “powerful” based on her extreme personal experimentation. “If I and people like me, even with the help of ste**ids, couldn’t close that natural gap, then asking a lifetime natural female athlete to compete against someone who went through male puberty feels extremely unfair to me,” Hussein concluded.

Bryce Mitchell announces he has been voted for ‘top 10 anti-Semites of the year’ for the second year in a row December 04, 2025 UFC star Bryce Mitchell has sparked renewed controversy after announcing on social media that he has been named to a “top 10 anti-Semites of the year” list for the second consecutive year—a designation he appears to embrace rather than reject. In a video posted to his social media channels, the Arkansas native delivered what can only be described as a defiant response to the recognition. “What’s crazy about winning this year is I didn’t even train, like I didn’t even try,” Mitchell stated. He stated: “Like seriously y’all probably thought you know what is this champion you gotta do to keep making this list and dude I don’t do anything I just exist as normal. I read my bible and quote scripture and then they keep calling me anti-semite.” Rather than issuing clarifications or apologies, Mitchell treated the designation as an achievement, suggesting he may have secured “first place” in the ranking. Mitchell’s comments took an increasingly alarming turn as he questioned why there hadn’t been more severe consequences for his inclusion on such a list. “I’m wondering like what are they gonna do. Like when are they gonna come kill me because like I’m still breathing. I figured they’regonna kill me,” he said. He then went on to invoke religious imagery: “Jesus he got to die and did it with honor. I don’t know why they’re letting me live.” The UFC competitor has become increasingly known for controversial statements that extend well beyond typical athlete commentary. Mitchell has recently used his platform to discuss topics ranging from U.S. foreign policy to allegations about his merchandise website being deliberately misdirected by search engines. The UFC has not yet issued a statement regarding Mitchell’s latest comments.

Steven Seagal Declares Himself Proudly Russian in Flawless English December 04, 2025 The former Hollywood action star who once dominated box offices has resurfaced in an unlikely role: cultural ambassador for the Kremlin. Steven Seagal, the 73-year-old actor known for his martial arts prowess in 1990s blockbusters, recently appeared before a packed auditorium to deliver an impassioned declaration of allegiance to his adopted homeland. Standing on stage as Russian officials introduced him to the crowd, Seagal delivered his remarks entirely in English, stating: “I am proud to be Russian, proud to be here today. And if God gives me the opportunity to be here longer and longer, I will be very very grateful to serve God and my country, and all of you people, and my people together in this theme of oneness. Thank you.” The video, which circulated on social media platform X this week, sparked immediate reactions online. The actor’s transformation from Hollywood heavyweight to Kremlin supporter represents one of the more peculiar celebrity reinventions in recent memory. Seagal obtained Russian citizenship in 2016, cultivating a relationship with President Vladimir Putin through their mutual interest in martial arts. The actor has publicly described Putin as a “brother” and “one of the greatest living world leaders.” His loyalty has not gone unrewarded. In 2023, Putin presented Seagal with the Order of Friendship, ostensibly recognizing his contributions to improving Russian-American relations. Last year, Seagal doubled down on his support by directing and starring in a 30-minute documentary titled “In The Name of Justice,” which appeared to justify Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine by blaming Ukrainian nationalists. The production included interviews with captured members of Ukraine’s Azov Brigade and footage from Russian-controlled Ukrainian territories. Social media users expressed skepticism about Seagal’s latest appearance. One observer quipped: “Of course he’s proud to be Russian – it’s the only country still pretending his movies are good.” Another joked: “Steven Seagal threatens to make new movies if US keeps arming Ukraine.” The documentary also drew attention for reasons beyond its political messaging. The once-muscular star of films like “Under Siege,” “Out for Justice,” and “Hard to Kill” appeared noticeably heavier than during his action hero heyday. A former colleague told the Daily Mail that Seagal had gained “at least 50 pounds,” noting that the actor typically exercised strict control over camera angles during productions to minimize attention to his weight gain. Seagal’s political statements have grown increasingly controversial. During his Order of Friendship ceremony, he reportedly characterized Ukraine as being known for “organ trafficking, child s*x trafficking and N**ism,” according to media reports.

Coffeezilla calls out ‘insane headlines’ about Hawk Tuah memecoin
YouTube investigator Coffeezilla has called for an end to the spread of misinformation about viral influencer Hailey Welch’s recent controversial memecoin launch, HAWK.
YouTube investigator Stephen Findeisen, better known as “Coffeezilla,” has called for an end to the spread of misleading headlines about viral influencer Hailey Welch, also known as "Hawk Tuah," following the controversial launch of her memecoin, HAWK.
“Can yall stop these insane headlines. She didn’t rug for 500M and she didn’t profit $50M,” Coffezilla said in a Dec. 6 X post to his 638,900 followers.
‘Let’s stay to what we know,’ says CoffeeZilla
Coffeezilla claimed that the team behind the memecoin “presold a few million” to strategic advisers who allegedly “sold early” before the tokens “got sniped.”
It comes after the Dec. 5 launch of Welch’s Hawk Tuah memecoin sparked outrage across social media as the newly launched token briefly pumped and then dumped rapidly following a controversial deployment involving allegations of snipers and insider wallets.
Since then, rumors have spread online, from lawsuits to claims of alleged profits from the memecoin, most of which Coffeezilla has said is misinformation.
“Lots to criticize here and I do, but let’s stay to what we know. Team made a few million,” Coffeezilla said while reiterating the “exact amount” is unknown.
“According to Hawk’s lawyer she’s seen $125k and her tokens unlock in a year,” he said.
He said it is “currently unknown” where all the profits from the transaction fees and the presale have gone.
Meanwhile, he stated that no legal action has been taken yet:
“Oh and she isn’t being sued (yet) so literally everything in this post is misinformation.”
It comes as United States law firm Burwick Law said in a Dec. 5 X post that victims of the launch should contact the law firm to understand their “legal rights.”
