2 Factions 2.1 The Idealists 2.2 The Militants
4 Members 4.1 Idealists 4.2 Militiants 4.3 Gasoline Provisional Team
Beach (ビーチ, Bīchi) is the name given to "Resort Hotel Tama Pacific" by Takeru Danma (Hatter), as well as the name of one of the groups in Alice in Borderland. It is a "utopia" founded by Hatter with the help of his friend Morizono Aguni to bring hope to the players by providing them with a haven filled with luxuries and comforts.
"WELCOME!! To the ideal utopia, the Beach!"— Takeru Danma, Chapter 15
The Beach is governed by a system of ranks. Each resident of the Beach is assigned a number that indicates their status within the organization, and the lower the number, the higher the rank. Those with the highest ranks (1 to 9) form the Executives, and No. 1 occupies the position of leader. As people die, a person's rank increases. People who contribute new or many cards may be promoted.
Within the Beach Executives, there are two factions that hold influence. The Idealist/Cult Sect was led by Hatter; important members were Kuzuryu, Ann, Mira, and Mahiru. The Martial Sect was led by Aguni; important members were Niragi and "Last Boss". They also have control over most of the firearms. However, the Martial Sect functions as a method for Aguni, secretly allied with Hatter, to keep the most violent residents contained. There are also other groups, such as the Gasoline Provisional Team, which Tatta is a part of.
You are free to live your life as you wish.
Death to all traitors. All cards must be given to the Top 1 resident, and no one may leave once admitted to the Beach. Going against this is considered "traitorous".
The Idealists follow Hatter's ideology. They establish the rules of the Beach and decide who participates in the games. Secretly, two members of this faction are Citizens of the Borderland who later take part in the Face Card games.
The Militants follow Aguni's ideology. They maintain control of the firearms and are willing to enforce the rules and eliminate those considered traitors to the Beach. Aguni, who is Hatter's close friend, leads this group to prevent the most violent residents, such as Niragi, from acting without restraint.
Unknown to the players, there are four infiltrators at the Beach. Asahi and Momoka are Dealers ordered to infiltrate the Beach and eventually initiate the Ten of Hearts game. Meanwhile, Kuzuryu and Mira are both Citizens who infiltrate the Beach out of curiosity.
After the death of the Hatter, the Beach becomes the game zone of the "Witch Hunt" game, and Aguni and his men murder most of the Beach residents. Once the truth behind the game and Aguni's intentions is revealed, a fire started by Niragi destroys the Beach after the survivors clear the game. However, Chishiya and Kuina recover the Ten of Hearts card just before the Beach burns down completely.

Alice in Borderland Season 1 Episode 7 Synopsis
Once a safe haven, the Beach becomes the arena for the next stage, where an epic witch hunt turns everyone against each other in a hostile showdown.
Arisu is a young man who finds himself lost in a parallel and abandoned Tokyo alongside his best friends, Chota and Karube. As they begin their search for civilization, the trio quickly finds out that they are trapped in a city in which they are forced to participate in risky, unhappy, and dangerous games, pushing their own emotional and physical limits in the process to survive.


--- SOURCE: https://www.eyesonshow.com/Imawa-no-Kuni-no-Arisu-Episode-5/ ---
Arisu was asking people for information about the Beach, but he had no leads at all. His visa was set to expire in just three days. He followed Yuzuha to go hunting, hoping to learn more hunting skills. Soon, it was night, and game time arrived. Yuzuha and Arisu spotted members of the Beach and decided to observe them first before following them to the Beach. The Beach members won the game and drove away in an old car. Arisu and Yuzuha chased after the car, running desperately, and eventually, they indeed found the Beach. Suddenly, Yuzuha was caught in a sack, and Arisu was knocked out. When Arisu and Yuzuha saw light again, they were tied to chairs. At this moment, they encountered Danma Hikaru, the founder of the Beach. Danma told Arisu that collecting all the playing cards would allow one person to return to the original world. For this reason, Danma established the Beach, using fuel to generate electricity, collecting rainwater, and even gathering weapons. Danma informed Arisu of the Beach’s three rules: everyone must wear swimwear at the Beach, as this prevents hiding weapons; all playing cards are to be kept by the Beach, and those who contribute to collecting the cards can rise in rank, with priority for returning to the original world determined by rank; finally, betraying the Beach would result in execution. Since Arisu had the Seven of Hearts, a card the Beach did not possess, Danma invited both Arisu and Yuzuha to join the Beach. After joining, they changed into swimwear and went to the poolside. In the distance, two women looked at them with strange gazes. As night fell, it was time to participate in the games again. Danma received fervent admiration from the Beach members, who gathered in the hall to cheer for him. In a corner, Kyūya Shuntarō looked at Arisu and Yuzuha and said to Mizuki beside him, "They might be useful to us." It seemed they were plotting something. Based on their numbered tags, Arisu and Yuzuha boarded corresponding cars to participate in games at different venues. The games seemed easier in front of the Beach members. Kuni, Nira, and Samura Ryōin all made appearances. Yuzuha participated in the Matchstick Factory Bingo game, where she had to use only nine matchsticks to find numbers hidden in 24 rooms and answer correctly to achieve bingo and clear the game. Arisu joined Anzu Tsukasa in a game, as Anzu wanted to test whether Arisu had the potential to become a Beach executive. The game had seven participants and was called "Lightbulb," with a difficulty level of Four of Diamonds. The rules were as follows: Rule 1: There are three switches in the room—A, B, and C—but only one can turn on the lightbulb. Rule 2: While the door is open, players have only one chance to flip a switch. If the door is closed, there is no limit to the number of times switches can be flipped. Rule 3: If someone is in the small room or if a switch is flipped to the "on" position, the door will lock and cannot be opened. The group has only one chance to answer, and they must choose the correct switch that controls the lightbulb to clear the game. If the water level rises and touches the wires, the game ends. The game began, and Anzu, looking confident, tasked Arisu with solving the puzzle. After analyzing the situation, Arisu successfully cleared the game, earning Anzu’s approval. Meanwhile, Yuzuha also cleared her game, and the two reunited at the poolside. Kuni, Nira, and Samura Ryōin, members of the militant faction, appeared at the poolside. Kuni approached, having taken a liking to Yuzuha, and attempted to claim her for himself. Arisu tried his best to stop him, but he was no match for Kuni alone. As the leader of the Beach’s militant faction, no one dared to challenge Kuni. Just then, Danma stepped in and stopped Kuni. Reluctantly, Kuni gave up on Yuzuha. The militant faction, led by Kuni, and the idealist faction, led by Danma, had irreconcilable conflicts. For now, Danma was still the nominal leader of the Beach, and even Kuni had to obey him. Danma called a meeting of the Beach executives, and due to Arisu’s performance, he was also invited. Arisu had clearly become an executive of the Beach. In the meeting room, the Beach executives looked at the wall covered with playing cards. Aside from the face cards, only the Ten of Hearts was missing. Danma’s visa was about to expire, which meant he would have to participate in the next game. After the meeting, Danma spoke with Arisu privately. From Danma, Arisu learned that Danma had originally been a host, running a host club. That club was called the Beach, and he had wanted everyone to live with dignity. However, one of his hosts had collapsed and committed suicide, and eventually, everyone else left him. This tormented him and forced him to mature quickly. After arriving in this world, he established the Beach, gathering everyone to serve his purposes. Danma’s ambition was to return to the original world.

Beach (ビーチ, Bīchi) is the name given to the "Seaside Paradise Tokyo" hotel by Takeru Danma (Hatter), as well as the name of one of the groups in the Alice in Borderland series. It was created by Hatter with the help of his friend, Morizono Aguni. It is meant to be a "utopia", a safe haven where players have hope, as they unite to find all of the cards and bring everyone back home, one by one, starting with Hatter himself.
Seaside Paradise Tokyo hotel (ビーチ bii chi)
The Beach is located in a large hotel "Seaside Paradise Tokyo". Members use fuels to generate electricity and rainwater as a water supply, so that everyone can enjoy their time. The transportation division provides Beach members with cars, which allows them to travel to game arenas more easily.
The Beach is governed by a rank system. Each resident of the Beach is assigned a number that indicates their status within the organization, the lower the number, the higher the rank, with #1 being the boss and ranks 2-9 forming the executive members. From the inside, the top of the organization is divided into two factions: idealists and militants. Idealists follow Hatter believing in his theory wholeheartedly, while militants listen to Aguni and control all firearms, which allows them to dispose of traitors.
While at the Beach, most people try to "escape from the reality" (as noted by Usagi): they drink cocktails, dance, party by the pool, sunbathe, and so on. The deadly games are perceived as another fun activity, and the players are excited when the evening comes. They cheer for Hatter who gives encouraging speeches and share his hope to eventually leave the Borderland by collecting all playing cards.
You must always wear swimsuits at the Beach, because you cannot hide firearms in a swimsuit, which makes it safe for everyone. Players are free to drink, take illegal substances and have sex, however, all the door locks are damaged with super glue, so nobody can hide anything.
All playing cards belong to the Beach. Those who have contributed more cards are promoted to a higher rank.
Beach executives from left to right: Niragi, Mira, Kuzuryu, Hatter, An, Chishiya, Last Boss, Aguni
There are about 200 members at the Beach, but the exact number remains unknown.
Known members of the idealists faction are:
The important members of the militants faction are:

Chishiya, a calculating and aloof player, shines in this game, outwitting others through his intellect and manipulation.
As the games progress, Arisu and Usagi confront the psychological toll of the Borderlands. Flashbacks reveal their struggles: Arisu grapples with his guilt over his friends’ deaths, while Usagi mourns the loss of her father. Their shared vulnerability strengthens their resolve to fight for survival and find meaning in their ordeal. The season’s climax centers on the final two face card games: the “Queen of Hearts” and the “King of Spades.”
In the Queen of Hearts game, Mira challenges Arisu and Usagi to a series of mind games designed to break their spirits. Mira manipulates them with claims that the Borderlands are a hallucination created by Arisu’s grief over his friends’ deaths. Despite her efforts, Arisu and Usagi reaffirm their will to survive and their connection to each other, ultimately defeating Mira in a battle of wits.
Simultaneously, the group confronts the King of Spades in an all-out war. After suffering heavy casualties, Arisu and his allies manage to take him down, symbolizing their defiance against the oppressive system of the Borderlands.
With all the face cards defeated, the survivors have a choice: remain in the Borderlands as citizens or return to the real world. Arisu and Usagi choose to leave, along with most of their allies.
In the final moments, the truth about the Borderlands is revealed: it’s a liminal space between life and death, where participants are those who have suffered near-fatal incidents in the real world. The games are a test of their will to live. Arisu wakes up in a hospital, learning he was caught in a meteorite explosion in Tokyo. Usagi and the other survivors were also victims of the same disaster. Though they retain no memory of the Borderlands, Arisu and Usagi feel a deep connection and meet again, hinting at a hopeful future together. The series concludes with a lingering shot of a Joker card, teasing that the story may not end.
Alice in Borderland explores themes of survival, humanity, and the value of life. The games serve as metaphors for societal struggles, pushing characters to confront their deepest fears and desires. With gripping action, complex characters, and thought-provoking questions about morality, the series captivates viewers while leaving room for interpretation and speculation.
