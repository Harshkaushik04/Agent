i need to write description about the tools present to the agent brain so help me make a list, each tool should have 4 things which you should be describing:purpose,input,output,typical use(describe a situation you might use it in), a strict condition which we gotta follow in these rules is that these tools should look like python functions for example for search query generator tool which takes input as a sentence it should look like search_query_generator(sentence)
before exaplining tools, lets first devise how database looks like there are 2 databases(both are .json files right now, will upgrade to mongo db later on)
USERS_DATABASE(users.json) which contains only 1 key 
{"users":[<list of usernames>]}
MAIN_DATABASE(db.json) which contains different keys like:
{"<username>":{"<sessionNumber>":x}}
(i have used words like "appropriaite/some name here but this would just be generated by the tools we discuss later)
x={"plan":<json of plan which we have made>,
"summaries":<json object with keys having some appropriate name with summary(string) as its value>,
"question_answers":<json object with keys having some name with answers to questions(string) as its value,
"top_k_context_chunks":<json object with key having some name and list of length k strings(k is not fixed here)>,
"database_for_rag":<json object with key having some name and corrosponding database(string) as value>,
"transcripted_audio_to_text":<json object with key having some name and correponding text(string) extracted by transcripting audio>,
"transcripted_video_to_text":<json object with key having some name 
and correponding text(string) extracted by transcripting video>,
"sentences":<json object with key having some name and sentence(string) as value>,
"search_queries":<json object with key having some name and list of arbitary number of search queries(string) as value>,
"urls":<json object with key having some name and list of arbitary number of urls(string) as value>,
"raw_htmls":<json object with key having url as name and value as raw html>,
"cleaned_htmls": <json object with key having url as name and value cleaned html>,
"generation":<json object with key having some name and value as list of 2 strings>
}
you must use examples to explain database structure 

these are the tools:
1. search query generator: takes input as a single sentence and divides into different parts each of which part is search engine query, for example for sentence "did pewdiepie and harkirat singh have a collab" it would divide sentence into ["pewdiepie","harkirat singh","pewdiepie harkirat singh collab"]  ,output is [list of strings,key name(string) where it would be stored inside "search_queries" key]
2. search engine-1 : takes single search query(string) and top_k(integer) as inputs and outputs [list of length top_k strings of urls,key name(string) where it would be stored inside "urls" key]
3. search engine-2 :takes a single url(string) as input and outputs [raw html of that url(string),key name(string) where it would be stored inside "raw_html" key]
4. html cleaner: takes [single raw html(string),url(string)] as input and outputs [cleaned text(string),key name(string) where it would be stored inside "cleaned_html" key]
5. write file: takes [file_path(string) which has to be written to,content(string):string we want to write,whether_addition(integer):if we want to do addition inside file(not overwrite already written content) then its =1 else if we want to overwrite then =0] as input and gives no output
6. read file: takes file_path(string) as input and outputs string of file content
7. make rag database: takes data(string) as input and outputs [folder path(string) in which we made vector database(which includes index.faiss,metadata.pkl),key name(string) where folder path would be stored inside "database_for_rag" key]
8. retrieval from rag database: takes [search query(string),top_k(integer):number of chunks we want to retrieve from database,database folder path(string)] as input and outputs [list of string of top_k chunks, key name(string) where its stored inside "top_k_context_chunks" key]
9. generation: generates answer based on rag ,takes [list of string top_k chunks,query(string)] as input and gives outputs as [full answer string,after think part of the string,key name(string) where its stored inside "generation" key]
10. file checker: checks whether there already exists a file named file_path, if no then outputs the same file_path,if yes then updates file path, takes file path(string) as input and outputs updated file path(string)
11. video to text: converts video s' audio to text, takes [video link/video local path, whether_link_or_path, if link then its =1, else if path its =0] as input and outputs [text string,key name(string) where its stored inside "transcripted_video_to_text" key]
12. audio to text:converts audio to text, takes [audio link/audio local path, whether_link_or_path, if link then its =1, else if path its =0] as input and outputs [text string,key 
name(string) where its stored inside "transcripted_audio_to_text" key]
13. question answer: answer the query based on some text, takes input as [text string,query string] and outputs [text string,key name(string) where its stored inside "question_answers" key]
14. summarise: summarises the text, takes input as text string and outputs [text string,key name(string) where its stored inside "summarise" key]
 
to help you structure these functions/tools, these are the format i need:
1. search_query_generation(sentence): [list of strings,key string]
2. search_engine_1(search_query,top_k): [list of string top_k urls,key string]
3. search_engine_2(url): [raw_html(string),key string]
4. html_cleaner(raw_html,url): [cleaned_html(string),key string]
5. write_file(file_path,content,whether_addition): <no output>
6. read_file(file_path): [file_content(string)]
7. make_rag_database(data): [folder_path(string),key string]
8. retrieval_from_rag_database(search_query,top_k,database_folder_path): [list of string top_k chunks,key string]
9. generation(list of string top_k chunks,query): [full answer string, after think string,key string]
10. file_checker(file_path): updated_file_path(string)
11. video_to_text(video_link/video_path,whether_link_or_path): [text string,key string]
12. audio_to_text(audio_link/audio_path,whether_link_or_path): [text string,key string]
13. question_answer(text,query): [text string,key string]
14. summarise(text):[text string,key string]

OK IGNORE THE INITIAL INSTRUCTION of making list, lets first just see how much you understood what my databases and tools look like, explain everything by taking example and also in the end assign yourself a task to do and try to complete it using these tools.
